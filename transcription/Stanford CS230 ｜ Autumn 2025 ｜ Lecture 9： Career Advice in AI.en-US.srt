What I want to do today is um chat with
 

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,790
What I want to do today is um chat with
you about career advice in AI. And um in

00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:10,800
you about career advice in AI. And um in
 

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,950
you about career advice in AI. And um in
previous years I used to do most of this

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:12,960
previous years I used to do most of this
 

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,190
previous years I used to do most of this
you know lecture by myself. But what I

career in AI. But there were just um two
 

29
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,709
career in AI. But there were just um two
slides and then one more thought I want

00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:42,719
slides and then one more thought I want
 

31
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,470

00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:53,199
the best time ever to be building with
 

39
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,229
the best time ever to be building with
AI and to building a career in AI. A few

40
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:56,239
AI and to building a career in AI. A few
 

41
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,630
AI and to building a career in AI. A few
months ago, I know that in social media,

42
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:58,640
months ago, I know that in social media,
 

43
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,229
months ago, I know that in social media,
traditional media, there are a few

44
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:00,239
traditional media, there are a few
 

45
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,229
traditional media, there are a few
questions about, you know, is AI slowing

46
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:02,239
questions about, you know, is AI slowing
 

47
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,630
questions about, you know, is AI slowing
down, right? I people saying, well, is

48
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:04,640
down, right? I people saying, well, is
 

49
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,789
down, right? I people saying, well, is
GPT5 that good? I I think it's actually

50
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
GPT5 that good? I I think it's actually
 

51
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:08,070
GPT5 that good? I I think it's actually
pretty good, but there are questions

52
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:08,080
pretty good, but there are questions
 

53
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,630
pretty good, but there are questions
about is AI progress slowing down. And I

54
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:10,640
about is AI progress slowing down. And I
 

55
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,390
about is AI progress slowing down. And I
think part of the reason the question

56
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:12,400
think part of the reason the question
 

57
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,710
think part of the reason the question
was even raised was because if a

58
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:14,720
was even raised was because if a
 

59
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,630
was even raised was because if a
benchmark for AI is, you know, 100% is

61
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,270
benchmark for AI is, you know, 100% is
perfect answers, then if you make rapid

62
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:21,280
perfect answers, then if you make rapid
 

63
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,350
perfect answers, then if you make rapid
progress, at some point you cannot get

64
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,360
progress, at some point you cannot get
 

65
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,670
progress, at some point you cannot get
above 100% accuracy.

66
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:25,680
above 100% accuracy.
 

67
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,390
above 100% accuracy.
But um one of the studies that most

68
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,400
But um one of the studies that most
 

69
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,950
But um one of the studies that most
influenced my thinking was work done by

70
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
influenced my thinking was work done by
 

71
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,910
influenced my thinking was work done by
uh this organization MER meter that

72
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:33,920
uh this organization MER meter that
 

73
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,510
uh this organization MER meter that
studied

74
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:35,520
studied
 

75
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,550
studied
as time passes how complex are the tasks

76
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:38,560
as time passes how complex are the tasks
 

77
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,190
as time passes how complex are the tasks
that AI could do as measured by how long

78
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,200
that AI could do as measured by how long
 

79
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,950
that AI could do as measured by how long
it takes a human to do that task. So few

80
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:44,960
it takes a human to do that task. So few
 

81
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,069
it takes a human to do that task. So few
years ago maybe GBD2 could do tasks that

82
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:48,079
years ago maybe GBD2 could do tasks that
 

83
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,910
years ago maybe GBD2 could do tasks that
a human could do in like you know couple

84
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:49,920
a human could do in like you know couple
 

85
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,069
a human could do in like you know couple
seconds and then they could do tasks

86
00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:52,079
seconds and then they could do tasks
 

87
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,230
seconds and then they could do tasks
that took a human 4 seconds then 8

88
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
that took a human 4 seconds then 8
 

89
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,069
that took a human 4 seconds then 8
seconds then like a you know a minute 2

AI can do is doubling every seven

96
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:05,280
AI can do is doubling every seven
 

97
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,869
AI can do is doubling every seven
months. Um and I think on this metric I

98
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:08,879
months. Um and I think on this metric I
 

99
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,430
months. Um and I think on this metric I
feel you know optimistic that AI will

100
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,440
feel you know optimistic that AI will
 

101
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,190
feel you know optimistic that AI will
continue making progress meaning the

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,030
long a human takes to do something is
doubling rapidly and same study with

108
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
doubling rapidly and same study with
 

109
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,990
doubling rapidly and same study with
smaller data set seems to same study

110
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
smaller data set seems to same study
 

111
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,470
smaller data set seems to same study
argued that AI coding um the doubling

112
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:26,480
argued that AI coding um the doubling
 

113
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,830
argued that AI coding um the doubling
time is even shorter maybe like 70 days.

114
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:29,840
time is even shorter maybe like 70 days.
 

115
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,070
time is even shorter maybe like 70 days.
So this code that used to take me you

116
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:32,080
So this code that used to take me you
 

117
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,990
So this code that used to take me you
know I don't know 10 minutes to write

118
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,000
know I don't know 10 minutes to write
 

119
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,670
know I don't know 10 minutes to write
then 20 minutes to write 40 minutes to

120
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
then 20 minutes to write 40 minutes to
 

121
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,910
then 20 minutes to write 40 minutes to
write and AI could do more and more of

122
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
write and AI could do more and more of
 

123
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,309
write and AI could do more and more of
that and so the reasons I think this is

124
00:02:40,309 --> 00:02:40,319
that and so the reasons I think this is
 

125
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,030
that and so the reasons I think this is
a golden age to be building best time

126
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,040
a golden age to be building best time
 

127
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,589
a golden age to be building best time
we've ever seen is um maybe two themes

128
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:45,599
we've ever seen is um maybe two themes
 

129
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,710
we've ever seen is um maybe two themes
which are more powerful and faster so we

130
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
which are more powerful and faster so we
 

131
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,350
which are more powerful and faster so we
can all all of you in this room can now

132
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:51,360
can all all of you in this room can now
 

133
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,070
can all all of you in this room can now
write software that is more powerful

134
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
write software that is more powerful
 

135
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,990
write software that is more powerful
than what anyone on the planet could

136
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
than what anyone on the planet could

have built you know like a year ago um

138
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280

by using AI building blocks. AI building

140
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,280
by using AI building blocks. AI building
 

141
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,190
by using AI building blocks. AI building
blocks include large language models,

142
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:03,200
blocks include large language models,
 

143
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,270

145
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,869
rack, augened workflows, voice AI, and
of course deep learning. It turns out

146
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
of course deep learning. It turns out
 

147
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,990
of course deep learning. It turns out
that a lot of LM have a decent at least

148

that a lot of LM have a decent at least
 

149
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,229
that a lot of LM have a decent at least
basic understanding of deep learning. So

150
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
basic understanding of deep learning. So
 

151
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,670

not bad at at helping you use these

162
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
not bad at at helping you use these
 

163
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,229
not bad at at helping you use these
building blocks to build software

164
00:03:24,229 --> 00:03:24,239
building blocks to build software
 

165
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,910
building blocks to build software
quickly. Um and and and so we have very

166
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
quickly. Um and and and so we have very
 

167
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,710
quickly. Um and and and so we have very
powerful building blocks that were very

168
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:30,720
powerful building blocks that were very
 

169
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,710
powerful building blocks that were very
difficult or did not exist a year or two

170
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:32,720
difficult or did not exist a year or two
 

171
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,149
difficult or did not exist a year or two
ago. And so you can now build software

172
00:03:34,149 --> 00:03:34,159
ago. And so you can now build software
 

173
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,149
ago. And so you can now build software
that does things that no one else on the

174
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
that does things that no one else on the
 

175
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,070
that does things that no one else on the
planet, right? Even the most advanced

176
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:38,080
planet, right? Even the most advanced
 

177
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,229
planet, right? Even the most advanced
users of the planet could have done. And

178
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
users of the planet could have done. And
 

179
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,630
users of the planet could have done. And
then also with um uh AI coding, the

180
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:44,640
then also with um uh AI coding, the
 

181
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,309
then also with um uh AI coding, the
speed with which you can get software

182
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
speed with which you can get software
 

183
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,270
speed with which you can get software
written is much faster than ever before.

184
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
written is much faster than ever before.
 

185
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,949
written is much faster than ever before.
And I personally found it as important

186
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:50,959
And I personally found it as important
 

187
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,030
And I personally found it as important
to stay on the frontier of tools because

188
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,040
to stay on the frontier of tools because
 

189
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,990
to stay on the frontier of tools because
the tools for AI coding changes right I

190
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:56,000
the tools for AI coding changes right I
 

191
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,070
the tools for AI coding changes right I
don't know really rapidly. So I feel

192
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
don't know really rapidly. So I feel
 

193
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,830
don't know really rapidly. So I feel
like um uh you know since several months

194
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
like um uh you know since several months
 

195
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,630
like um uh you know since several months
ago my personal number one favorite tool

196
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
ago my personal number one favorite tool
 

197
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,830
ago my personal number one favorite tool
became cloud code um moving on from some

198
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:07,840
became cloud code um moving on from some
 

199
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,550
became cloud code um moving on from some
early generations I think uh and then I

200
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
early generations I think uh and then I
 

201
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,350
early generations I think uh and then I
think um since the release of GPD5 I

202
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:13,360
think um since the release of GPD5 I
 

203
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,509
think um since the release of GPD5 I
think openey codeex has actually made

204
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
think openey codeex has actually made
 

205
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,150
think openey codeex has actually made
tremendous progress and this morning

206
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,160
tremendous progress and this morning
 

207
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,469
tremendous progress and this morning
Gemini 3 was released which you know

208
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
Gemini 3 was released which you know
 

209
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:21,670
Gemini 3 was released which you know
haven't had time to play with it yet

210
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:21,680
haven't had time to play with it yet
 

211
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,270
haven't had time to play with it yet
just this morning right seems like

212
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
just this morning right seems like
 

213
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,909
just this morning right seems like
another huge leap forward so I feel like

214
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:25,919
another huge leap forward so I feel like
 

215
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,670
another huge leap forward so I feel like
if you ask me every three months what my

216
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
if you ask me every three months what my
 

217
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,590
if you ask me every three months what my
personal favorite coding tool is. It

218
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
personal favorite coding tool is. It
 

219
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,270
personal favorite coding tool is. It
actually probably changes definitely

220
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
actually probably changes definitely
 

221
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,870
actually probably changes definitely
every six months, but quite possibly

222
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:32,880
every six months, but quite possibly
 

223
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,310
every six months, but quite possibly
every three months. And I find that um

224
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
every three months. And I find that um
 

225
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,230
every three months. And I find that um
being half a generation behind in these

226

being half a generation behind in these
 

227
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,110
being half a generation behind in these
tools means being frankly quite a bit

228
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,120
tools means being frankly quite a bit
 

229
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,189
tools means being frankly quite a bit
less productive. And I know everyone

230
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:43,199
less productive. And I know everyone
 

231
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,990
less productive. And I know everyone
says AI is moving so fast so fast, but

237
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,710

as the hype says it does, but AI coding
 

239
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,790

00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:54,800
tools is one sector where I see the pace
 

241
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,870
tools is one sector where I see the pace
of progress is is tremendous. and

00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
of progress is is tremendous. and

powerful software and build it much

252
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
powerful software and build it much
 

253
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,390

259
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,629
more strongly now than even a year ago
or two years ago is just go and build

a loop where we'll write some software,

300
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
a loop where we'll write some software,
 

301
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,870

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,830
building software has become much
cheaper and much faster than before but

that ironically shifts the bottleneck to
 

331
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,550
that ironically shifts the bottleneck to
deciding what to build. Um so

332
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
deciding what to build. Um so
 

333
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,430
deciding what to build. Um so
um some weird trends I'm seeing in

um some weird trends I'm seeing in
 

335
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,950
um some weird trends I'm seeing in

that I'm seeing um in Silicon Valley

410
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
that I'm seeing um in Silicon Valley
 

411
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,469
that I'm seeing um in Silicon Valley
today. And I I I I I feel like um at the

412
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
today. And I I I I I feel like um at the
 

413
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,390
today. And I I I I I feel like um at the
earliest stage in my career, one thing I

414
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:20,400
earliest stage in my career, one thing I
 

415
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,589
earliest stage in my career, one thing I
regretted for years was um in one of the

416
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
regretted for years was um in one of the
 

417
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,790
regretted for years was um in one of the
roles I had, I went to try to convince a

418
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:26,800
roles I had, I went to try to convince a
 

419
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,029
roles I had, I went to try to convince a
bunch of engineers to do more product

420
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
bunch of engineers to do more product
 

421
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,110
bunch of engineers to do more product
work. And I actually made a bunch of

422
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:31,120
work. And I actually made a bunch of
 

423
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,269
work. And I actually made a bunch of
really good engineers feel bad for not

424
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
really good engineers feel bad for not
 

425
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,029
really good engineers feel bad for not
being good product managers. And that

426
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
being good product managers. And that
 

427
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,190
being good product managers. And that
was a mistake I made. Regretted that for

428
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,200
was a mistake I made. Regretted that for
 

429
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,269
was a mistake I made. Regretted that for
years. I just shouldn't have done that.

430
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
years. I just shouldn't have done that.
 

431
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,029
years. I just shouldn't have done that.
And part of me feels like I'm now going

432
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
And part of me feels like I'm now going
 

433
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,670
And part of me feels like I'm now going
back to repeat that exact same mistake.

434
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:43,680
back to repeat that exact same mistake.
 

435
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,350
back to repeat that exact same mistake.
Um, having said that, I find that um,

436
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:47,360
Um, having said that, I find that um,
 

437
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,430
Um, having said that, I find that um,
uh, the fact that, you know, I can write

438
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:49,440
uh, the fact that, you know, I can write
 

439
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,070
uh, the fact that, you know, I can write
code, but also talk to users to shape

440
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
code, but also talk to users to shape
 

441
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,910
code, but also talk to users to shape
what to do. That lets me and the

442
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:53,920
what to do. That lets me and the
 

443
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,430
what to do. That lets me and the
engineers that can do this go much

444
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
engineers that can do this go much
 

445
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,509
engineers that can do this go much
faster. So I think maybe worth taking

446
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
faster. So I think maybe worth taking
 

447
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,310
faster. So I think maybe worth taking
another look at whether engineers can

448
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
another look at whether engineers can
 

449
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,870
another look at whether engineers can
um, do a bit more of this work. uh

450
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:02,880
um, do a bit more of this work. uh
 

451
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,710
um, do a bit more of this work. uh
because then if you're not waiting for

452
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:04,720
because then if you're not waiting for
 

453
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,150
because then if you're not waiting for
someone else to take the product to

454
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,160
someone else to take the product to
 

455
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,990
someone else to take the product to
customers, you just write code, have a

456
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
customers, you just write code, have a
 

457
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,750
customers, you just write code, have a
gut for what to do next and iterate that

458
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
gut for what to do next and iterate that
 

459
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,470
gut for what to do next and iterate that

faster.
And then before I handle Lawrence, um

464
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,240
And then before I handle Lawrence, um
 

465
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,230
And then before I handle Lawrence, um
just just one one one last thing I want

466
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:18,240
just just one one one last thing I want
 

467
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,910
just just one one one last thing I want
to share which is uh in terms of

468
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
to share which is uh in terms of
 

469
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,389
to share which is uh in terms of
navigating your career, I think one of

470
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:24,399
navigating your career, I think one of
 

471
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,110
navigating your career, I think one of
the most strong predictors for your

00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:27,120
the most strong predictors for your
 

473
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,670
the most strong predictors for your
speed of learning and for your level of

474
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
speed of learning and for your level of
 

475
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,590
speed of learning and for your level of
success is the people you surround

476
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:31,600
success is the people you surround
 

477
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,030
success is the people you surround
yourself with. I think we're all social

478
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
yourself with. I think we're all social
 

479
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,470
yourself with. I think we're all social
creatures. We all learn from people

480
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
creatures. We all learn from people
 

481
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,470
creatures. We all learn from people
around us. And um it turns out that uh

482
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
around us. And um it turns out that uh
 

483
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,150
around us. And um it turns out that uh
it turns out there, you know, studies in

484
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,160
it turns out there, you know, studies in
 

485
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,470
it turns out there, you know, studies in
sociology that show that right if your

486
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
sociology that show that right if your
 

487
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,710
sociology that show that right if your
five closest friends are smokers, the

488
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:44,720
five closest friends are smokers, the
 

489
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,230
five closest friends are smokers, the
odds of you being a smoker is pretty

490
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
odds of you being a smoker is pretty
 

491
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,070
odds of you being a smoker is pretty
much high. Please don't smoke. Right.

492
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:48,080
much high. Please don't smoke. Right.
 

493
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,430
much high. Please don't smoke. Right.
Right. Just just just a example. Um I

494
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
Right. Just just just a example. Um I
 

495
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,350
Right. Just just just a example. Um I
don't know of any studies showing that

496
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
don't know of any studies showing that
 

497
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,750
don't know of any studies showing that
if your five or 10 closest friends are

498
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:55,760
if your five or 10 closest friends are
 

499
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,790
if your five or 10 closest friends are
really hardworking, determined people,

500
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:58,800
really hardworking, determined people,
 

501
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,949
really hardworking, determined people,
you know, learning quickly, trying to

502
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:00,959
you know, learning quickly, trying to
 

503
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,389
you know, learning quickly, trying to
make the world a better place of AI,

504
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:02,399
make the world a better place of AI,
 

505
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,710
make the world a better place of AI,
that you are more likely to do that too.

506
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
that you are more likely to do that too.
 

507
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,230
that you are more likely to do that too.
But it's one of those things that I

508
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
But it's one of those things that I
 

509
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,389
But it's one of those things that I
think is almost certainly true. So all

510
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
think is almost certainly true. So all
 

511
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,829
think is almost certainly true. So all
of us are inspired by the people around

512
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
of us are inspired by the people around
 

513
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,509
of us are inspired by the people around
us and you're able to find a good group

514
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
us and you're able to find a good group
 

515
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,990
us and you're able to find a good group
of people to work with that helps drive

516
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
of people to work with that helps drive
 

517
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,470
of people to work with that helps drive
you forward. Um in fact here at Stanford

518
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
you forward. Um in fact here at Stanford
 

519
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,230

591
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,269

so I find that that group of friends you

598
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
so I find that that group of friends you
 

599
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,550
so I find that that group of friends you
surround yourself with those little

600
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:44,560
surround yourself with those little
 

601
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,630
surround yourself with those little
pieces of information. Try this, don't

602
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:46,640
pieces of information. Try this, don't
 

603
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,550
pieces of information. Try this, don't
do that. That's just hype. Ignore the

604
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
do that. That's just hype. Ignore the
 

605
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,470

607
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,110
PR, you know, don't don't actually try
that thing. Those things um make a big

608
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
that thing. Those things um make a big
 

609
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,269
that thing. Those things um make a big
difference in your ability to to to

610
00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:55,279
difference in your ability to to to
 

611
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,949
difference in your ability to to to
steer the direction of your projects.

612

steer the direction of your projects.
 

613
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,550
steer the direction of your projects.
So, so while you're at Stanford, take

614
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:58,560
So, so while you're at Stanford, take
 

615
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,069
So, so while you're at Stanford, take
take advantage of that. This connective

616
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:00,079
take advantage of that. This connective
 

617
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,230
take advantage of that. This connective
tissue that Stanford has is actually

618
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,240
tissue that Stanford has is actually
 

619
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,590
tissue that Stanford has is actually
really unique. There are lots of great

620
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:03,600
really unique. There are lots of great
 

621
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,509
really unique. There are lots of great
universities in the world, but at this

622
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:05,519
universities in the world, but at this
 

623
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,110
universities in the world, but at this
moment in time, I don't think there's

624
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,120
moment in time, I don't think there's
 

625
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,430
moment in time, I don't think there's
any any h I I don't want to sound like

any any h I I don't want to sound like
 

627
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,269
any any h I I don't want to sound like
I'm doing PR for Stanford now, but I

628
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
I'm doing PR for Stanford now, but I
 

629
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,629
I'm doing PR for Stanford now, but I
really think there's no university in

630
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:12,639
really think there's no university in
 

631
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,870
really think there's no university in
the world that is uh as privileged as

632
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:14,880
the world that is uh as privileged as
 

633
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,550
the world that is uh as privileged as
Stanford at this moment in time in terms

634
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:16,560
Stanford at this moment in time in terms
 

635
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,710
Stanford at this moment in time in terms
of the richness of the connectivity to

636
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:18,720
of the richness of the connectivity to
 

637
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,550
of the richness of the connectivity to
to all of the leading um uh AI groups.

638
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,560
to all of the leading um uh AI groups.
 

639
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,110
to all of the leading um uh AI groups.
Um but to me that does also that we're

640
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:25,120
Um but to me that does also that we're

696
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
job at this company. This student joined

exciting AI project. And after he signed
 

701
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,350

on dotted line, he was assigned to work

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
on dotted line, he was assigned to work
 

703
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,430
on dotted line, he was assigned to work
on the backend Java payment processing

704
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:37,440
on the backend Java payment processing
 

705
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,910
on the backend Java payment processing
system of the company. Nothing against

706
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:39,920
system of the company. Nothing against
 

707
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,350
system of the company. Nothing against
anyone that wants to do Java backend

708
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,360
anyone that wants to do Java backend
 

709
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,629
anyone that wants to do Java backend
payment processing systems. I think

710
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
payment processing systems. I think
 

711
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,870
payment processing systems. I think
they're great, but this was AI students

712
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
they're great, but this was AI students
 

713
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,870
they're great, but this was AI students
that did not get matched to an AI

714
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:46,880
that did not get matched to an AI
 

715
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,190
that did not get matched to an AI
project. And so, uh, for about a year,

716
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:49,200
project. And so, uh, for about a year,
 

717
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,790
project. And so, uh, for about a year,
he was really frustrated and he actually

718
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
he was really frustrated and he actually
 

719
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,910
he was really frustrated and he actually
left his company after about a year.

720
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
left his company after about a year.
 

721
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,550
left his company after about a year.
The unfortunate thing is I told this

722
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
The unfortunate thing is I told this
 

723
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,949
The unfortunate thing is I told this
story in CS230 some years back and then

724
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
story in CS230 some years back and then
 

725
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,389
story in CS230 some years back and then
um uh after I was already telling the

726
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
um uh after I was already telling the
 

727
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,949
um uh after I was already telling the
story in this class,

728
00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:06,959
story in this class,
 

729
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,150
story in this class,
a couple years later, another student uh

730
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:10,160
a couple years later, another student uh
 

731
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,189
a couple years later, another student uh
in CSU30 went through the same

732
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:13,199
in CSU30 went through the same
 

733
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,189
in CSU30 went through the same
experience with the same company, not

734
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199
experience with the same company, not
 

735
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,790
experience with the same company, not
Java back and payment processing but a

736
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
Java back and payment processing but a
 

737
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,710
Java back and payment processing but a
different project. And I think this

738
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:18,720
different project. And I think this
 

739
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,590
different project. And I think this
effect of um trying to figure out who

740
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:21,600
effect of um trying to figure out who
 

741
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,710
effect of um trying to figure out who
you'll be actually working with

742
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
you'll be actually working with
 

743
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,069
you'll be actually working with
day-to-day and making sure you're

744
00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:24,079
day-to-day and making sure you're
 

745
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,829
day-to-day and making sure you're
surrounded by people that inspire you

746
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:25,839
surrounded by people that inspire you
 

747
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,350
surrounded by people that inspire you
and work on exciting projects, I think

748
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
and work on exciting projects, I think
 

749
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,949
and work on exciting projects, I think
that's important. And if you're

750
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
that's important. And if you're
 

751
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,269
that's important. And if you're
completely candid, if a company refuses

752
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
completely candid, if a company refuses
 

753
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,710
completely candid, if a company refuses
to tell you what team you'll be assigned

754
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:32,720
to tell you what team you'll be assigned
 

755
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,350
to tell you what team you'll be assigned
to, you know, that that that does raise

756
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
to, you know, that that that does raise
 

757
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,430
to, you know, that that that does raise
a question in my mind, right? Uh of

758
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:37,440
a question in my mind, right? Uh of
 

759
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,949
a question in my mind, right? Uh of
whether or not, you know, what will

760
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
whether or not, you know, what will
 

761
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,670
whether or not, you know, what will
happen. Um, and I think that um, instead

762
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,680
happen. Um, and I think that um, instead
 

763
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,110
happen. Um, and I think that um, instead
of working for the company with the

764
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
of working for the company with the
 

765
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,310
of working for the company with the
hottest brand, sometimes if you find a

766
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:46,320
hottest brand, sometimes if you find a
 

767
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,230
hottest brand, sometimes if you find a
really good team with really, you know,

768
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:48,240
really good team with really, you know,
 

769
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,310
really good team with really, you know,
hardworking, knowledgeable, smart people

770
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:50,320
hardworking, knowledgeable, smart people
 

771
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,389
hardworking, knowledgeable, smart people
trying to do good with AI, but the

772
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399
trying to do good with AI, but the
 

773
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,790
trying to do good with AI, but the
company logo just isn't as hot. I think

774
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
company logo just isn't as hot. I think
 

775
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,870
company logo just isn't as hot. I think
that often means you actually learn

776
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
that often means you actually learn
 

777
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,189
that often means you actually learn
faster and progress your career better.

778
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
faster and progress your career better.
 

779
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,189
faster and progress your career better.
Uh, because it is, after all, we don't

780
00:15:01,189 --> 00:15:01,199
Uh, because it is, after all, we don't
 

781
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,829
Uh, because it is, after all, we don't
learn from the, you know, excitement of

782
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:03,839
learn from the, you know, excitement of
 

783
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,269
learn from the, you know, excitement of
the company logo when you walk through

784
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:05,279
the company logo when you walk through
 

785
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,030
the company logo when you walk through
the door. You learn from the people you

786
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,040
the door. You learn from the people you
 

787
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,430
the door. You learn from the people you
deal with dayto-day. So I just urge you

788
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:09,440
deal with dayto-day. So I just urge you
 

789
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,269

797
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,670
think um and and and then uh but but I
think number one uh on on my advice is

798
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:25,680
think number one uh on on my advice is
 

799
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,150
think number one uh on on my advice is
it's become much easier than ever before

800
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:28,160
it's become much easier than ever before
 

801
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,269
it's become much easier than ever before
to build powerful software faster. And

802
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
to build powerful software faster. And
 

803
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,350
to build powerful software faster. And
what that means is um do be responsible.

804
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
what that means is um do be responsible.
 

805
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,509
what that means is um do be responsible.
Don't build software that hurts others.

806
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
Don't build software that hurts others.
 

807
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,389
Don't build software that hurts others.
uh and at the same time there are so

808
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:38,399
uh and at the same time there are so
 

809
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,470
uh and at the same time there are so
many things that each of you can build

810
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:40,480
many things that each of you can build
 

811
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,990
many things that each of you can build
and what I find is the number of ideas

812
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:42,000
and what I find is the number of ideas
 

813
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,990
and what I find is the number of ideas
out in the world is much greater the

814
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
out in the world is much greater the
 

815
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,509
out in the world is much greater the
number of people with the skill to build

816
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
number of people with the skill to build
 

817
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,910
number of people with the skill to build
them so I know that finding jobs has

818
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:47,920
them so I know that finding jobs has
 

819
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,590
them so I know that finding jobs has
gotten tougher for fresh college grads

820
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
gotten tougher for fresh college grads
 

821
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,509
gotten tougher for fresh college grads
at the same time a lot of teams you know

822
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
at the same time a lot of teams you know
 

823
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,590
at the same time a lot of teams you know
we just can't find enough skilled people

824
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
we just can't find enough skilled people
 

825
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,389
we just can't find enough skilled people
right uh and so there are a lot of

826
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:56,399
right uh and so there are a lot of
 

827
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,069
right uh and so there are a lot of
projects in the world that if you don't

828
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
projects in the world that if you don't
 

829
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,990
projects in the world that if you don't
build it I think no one else will build

830
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
build it I think no one else will build
 

831
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,470
build it I think no one else will build
it either uh so you don't need to so

832
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480
it either uh so you don't need to so
 

833
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,069
it either uh so you don't need to so
long as you don't harm others you know

834
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
long as you don't harm others you know
 

835
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,990
long as you don't harm others you know
to to be respons responsible. There a

836
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
to to be respons responsible. There a
 

837
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,110
to to be respons responsible. There a
lot of things that you don't need to

838
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
lot of things that you don't need to
 

839
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,310
lot of things that you don't need to
wait for permission. You don't need to

840
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
wait for permission. You don't need to
 

841
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,670
wait for permission. You don't need to
wait for someone else to do it first and

842
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
wait for someone else to do it first and
 

843
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,710
wait for someone else to do it first and
then you do it. Um the cost of a failure

844
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:12,720
then you do it. Um the cost of a failure
 

845
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,509
then you do it. Um the cost of a failure
is much lower than before because you

846
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:15,519
is much lower than before because you
 

847
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,749
is much lower than before because you
waste a weekend but learn something that

848
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
waste a weekend but learn something that
 

849
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,069
waste a weekend but learn something that
seems fine to me. So I think so long as

850
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:20,079
seems fine to me. So I think so long as
 

851
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,069
seems fine to me. So I think so long as
you're being responsible going for

852
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:22,079
you're being responsible going for
 

853
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,150
you're being responsible going for
trying things out um and building lots

854
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
trying things out um and building lots
 

855
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,470
trying things out um and building lots
of things would would be the number one

856
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
of things would would be the number one
 

857
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,470
of things would would be the number one
most important thing I think would help

858
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,480
most important thing I think would help
 

859
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,189
most important thing I think would help
your careers. Um, and uh, yeah, I think

860
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
your careers. Um, and uh, yeah, I think
 

861
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:35,189
your careers. Um, and uh, yeah, I think
I think uh, I'm going to say one last

862
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:35,199
I think uh, I'm going to say one last
 

863
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,670
I think uh, I'm going to say one last
thing that is um, considered not

864
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:37,680
thing that is um, considered not
 

865
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,990
thing that is um, considered not
politically correct in some circles. Uh,

866
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,000
politically correct in some circles. Uh,
 

867
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,990
politically correct in some circles. Uh,
but but I'll just say it anyway, which

868
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
but but I'll just say it anyway, which
 

869
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,269
but but I'll just say it anyway, which
is in some circles it has become

870
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:45,279
is in some circles it has become
 

871
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,350
is in some circles it has become
considered not politically correct to

872
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
considered not politically correct to
 

873
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,790
considered not politically correct to
encourage others to work hard. I'm going

874
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
encourage others to work hard. I'm going
 

875
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,389
encourage others to work hard. I'm going
to encourage you to work hard. Now I

876
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
to encourage you to work hard. Now I
 

877
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,910
to encourage you to work hard. Now I
think the reason some people don't like

878
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
think the reason some people don't like
 

879
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,910
think the reason some people don't like
that is because there are some people

880
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:57,920
that is because there are some people
 

881
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,430
that is because there are some people
they're in a phase of life where they're

882
00:16:59,430 --> 00:16:59,440
they're in a phase of life where they're
 

883
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,749
they're in a phase of life where they're
not in a position to work hard. So right

884
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
not in a position to work hard. So right
 

885
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,829
not in a position to work hard. So right
after my children were born I was not

886
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:03,839
after my children were born I was not
 

887
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,429
after my children were born I was not
working hard you know for a short period

888
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,439
working hard you know for a short period
 

889
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,510
working hard you know for a short period
of time right uh and there are people

890
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
of time right uh and there are people
 

891
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,870
of time right uh and there are people
because of a injury disability you know

892
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:10,880
because of a injury disability you know
 

893
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,710
because of a injury disability you know
whatever very valid reasons they're not

894
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
whatever very valid reasons they're not
 

895
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,069
whatever very valid reasons they're not
in a position to work hard at that

896
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:14,079
in a position to work hard at that
 

897
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,909
in a position to work hard at that
moment in time and we should respect

898
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:15,919
moment in time and we should respect
 

899
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,189
moment in time and we should respect
them support them make sure they're well

900
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:17,199
them support them make sure they're well
 

901
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,630
them support them make sure they're well
taken care of even though they're not

902
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:18,640
taken care of even though they're not
 

903
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,270
taken care of even though they're not
working hard. Having said that, all of

904
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
working hard. Having said that, all of
 

905
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,270
working hard. Having said that, all of
my, you know, say PhD students, they

906
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:23,280
my, you know, say PhD students, they
 

907
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,270
my, you know, say PhD students, they
became very successful. I saw every

908
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:25,280
became very successful. I saw every
 

909
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,110
became very successful. I saw every
single one of them work incredibly hard.

910
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
single one of them work incredibly hard.
 

911
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,870
single one of them work incredibly hard.
I mean, the 2 AM sitting up

912
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:28,880
I mean, the 2 AM sitting up
 

913
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,710
I mean, the 2 AM sitting up
hyperparameter tuning, you know, been

914
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:30,720
hyperparameter tuning, you know, been
 

915
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,390
hyperparameter tuning, you know, been
there, done that, right? Still doing it

916
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
there, done that, right? Still doing it
 

917
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,710
there, done that, right? Still doing it
some days. Uh, and if you are fortunate

918
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
some days. Uh, and if you are fortunate
 

919
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,710
some days. Uh, and if you are fortunate
enough to be in a position in life where

920
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:36,720
enough to be in a position in life where
 

921
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,470
enough to be in a position in life where
you can work really hard, um, there are

922
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
you can work really hard, um, there are
 

923
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,549
you can work really hard, um, there are
so many opportunities to do things right

924
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
so many opportunities to do things right
 

925
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,310
so many opportunities to do things right
now. Um, if you get excited as I do,

926
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
now. Um, if you get excited as I do,
 

927
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,909
now. Um, if you get excited as I do,
spending evenings and weekends coding

928
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
spending evenings and weekends coding
 

929
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,350
spending evenings and weekends coding
and building stuff and getting user

930
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,360
and building stuff and getting user
 

931
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,190
and building stuff and getting user
feedback, you know, if you lean in and

932
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:51,200
feedback, you know, if you lean in and
 

933
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,950
feedback, you know, if you lean in and
do those things, it will increase your

934
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:52,960
do those things, it will increase your
 

935
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,270
do those things, it will increase your
odds of being really successful. So, I

936
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
odds of being really successful. So, I
 

937
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,710
odds of being really successful. So, I
don't know, maybe I get into some some

938
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:56,720
don't know, maybe I get into some some
 

939
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,070
don't know, maybe I get into some some
trouble with some people encourage you

940
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
trouble with some people encourage you
 

941
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,230
trouble with some people encourage you
to work hard, but I find that uh the

942
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:00,240
to work hard, but I find that uh the
 

943
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,630
to work hard, but I find that uh the
truth is people that work hard get a lot

944
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
truth is people that work hard get a lot
 

945
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,390
truth is people that work hard get a lot
more done. We should also respect people

946
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
more done. We should also respect people
 

947
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,830
more done. We should also respect people
that don't and people that aren't in a

948
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
that don't and people that aren't in a
 

949
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,630
that don't and people that aren't in a
position to do so. But um uh you know

950
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
position to do so. But um uh you know
 

951
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,029
position to do so. But um uh you know
between watching some dumb TV show

952
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
between watching some dumb TV show
 

953
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,669
between watching some dumb TV show

the people or at least he thought he
 

1111
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,510
the people or at least he thought he
had. And then every time within a day,

1112
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
had. And then every time within a day,
 

1113
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,029
had. And then every time within a day,
the recruiter would call him and say,

1114
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039
the recruiter would call him and say,
 

1115
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,230
the recruiter would call him and say,
"No, you didn't get the job."

1116
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
"No, you didn't get the job."
 

1117
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,830
"No, you didn't get the job."
And it was like it was it was

1118
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:05,840
And it was like it was it was
 

1119
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,630
And it was like it was it was
heartbreaking. And like I said, 300 plus

1120
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640
heartbreaking. And like I said, 300 plus
 

1121
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,029
heartbreaking. And like I said, 300 plus
jobs he had been tracking. So, I started

1122
00:21:11,029 --> 00:21:11,039
jobs he had been tracking. So, I started
 

1123
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,870
jobs he had been tracking. So, I started
working with him to kind of do some mock

1124
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:12,880
working with him to kind of do some mock
 

1125
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,789
working with him to kind of do some mock
interviews and to do some fine-tuning.

1126
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:14,799
interviews and to do some fine-tuning.
 

1127
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,710
interviews and to do some fine-tuning.
Um, oh, it was uh it was Jeff Bezos

company, not Amazon. Um, that was one of
 

1131
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,230
company, not Amazon. Um, that was one of
the other big tech company that he'd

1132
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,240
the other big tech company that he'd
 

1133
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,149
the other big tech company that he'd
interviewed with. And I started like

candidate. Couldn't figure out what was

1142
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
candidate. Couldn't figure out what was
 

1143
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,110
candidate. Couldn't figure out what was
going wrong until I decided to try and

1144
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:31,120
going wrong until I decided to try and
 

1145
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,510
going wrong until I decided to try and
do a different sort of interview where I

1146
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:33,520
do a different sort of interview where I
 

1147
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,549
do a different sort of interview where I
gave him a really tough interview. I

1148
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:36,559
gave him a really tough interview. I
 

1149
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,110
gave him a really tough interview. I
gave him some tough lead code. I gave

1150
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,120
gave him some tough lead code. I gave
 

1151
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,630
gave him some tough lead code. I gave
him some really obscure corner cases in

1152
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
him some really obscure corner cases in
 

1153
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,390
him some really obscure corner cases in
his coding and I saw how he reacted and

1154
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
his coding and I saw how he reacted and
 

1155
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,710
his coding and I saw how he reacted and
how he reacted was the advice that was

1156
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
how he reacted was the advice that was
 

1157
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,310
how he reacted was the advice that was
given to him in the recruiting

1158
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,320
given to him in the recruiting
 

1159
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,909
given to him in the recruiting
pamphlets. And a lot of these recruiting

1160
00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:51,919
pamphlets. And a lot of these recruiting
 

1161
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,990
pamphlets. And a lot of these recruiting
pamphlets will say things like you're

1162
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
pamphlets will say things like you're
 

1163
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,270
pamphlets will say things like you're
going to have an opp you're going to

1164
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
going to have an opp you're going to
 

1165
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,750
going to have an opp you're going to
have a an opportunity to share an

1166
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:57,760
have a an opportunity to share an
 

1167
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,590
have a an opportunity to share an
opinion and you got to stand your

1168
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
opinion and you got to stand your
 

1169
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,430
opinion and you got to stand your
ground. You got to have a backbone.

1170
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,440
ground. You got to have a backbone.
 

1171
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,190
ground. You got to have a backbone.
Don't bend.

1172
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:03,200
Don't bend.
 

1173
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,590
Don't bend.
His interpretation of that was to be

1174
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600
His interpretation of that was to be
 

1175
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,630
His interpretation of that was to be
really really tough. Right? So I would

1176
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:08,640
really really tough. Right? So I would
 

1177
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,470
really really tough. Right? So I would
pick corners in his I would pick holes

1178
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:10,480
pick corners in his I would pick holes
 

1179
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,710
pick corners in his I would pick holes
in his code. I'd pick corner cases where

1180
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:12,720
in his code. I'd pick corner cases where
 

1181
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,549
in his code. I'd pick corner cases where
things may not work and I would give him

1182
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
things may not work and I would give him
 

1183
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,789
things may not work and I would give him
a test of crisis. And this advice that

1184
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:16,799
a test of crisis. And this advice that
 

1185
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,029
a test of crisis. And this advice that
he'd been given to stand his ground

1186
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:19,039
he'd been given to stand his ground
 

1187
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,669
he'd been given to stand his ground
ended up making him kind of hostile in

1188
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
ended up making him kind of hostile in
 

1189
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,029
ended up making him kind of hostile in
these interview environments. And I was

1190
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:25,039
these interview environments. And I was
 

1191
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,470
these interview environments. And I was
looking at this then from the point of

1192
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,480
looking at this then from the point of
 

1193
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,909
looking at this then from the point of
view of what Andrew was just talking

1194
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919
view of what Andrew was just talking
 

1195
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,470
view of what Andrew was just talking
about where it's a case of hey good

1196
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:30,480
about where it's a case of hey good
 

1197
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,390
about where it's a case of hey good
people good teams people that you can

1198
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
people good teams people that you can
 

1199
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,149
people good teams people that you can
work together with. And from the

1200
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
work together with. And from the
 

1201
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,830
work together with. And from the
interviewer perspective, if I'm managing

1202
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
interviewer perspective, if I'm managing
 

1203
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,390
interviewer perspective, if I'm managing
this team, this person is that cliche

1204
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,400
this team, this person is that cliche
 

1205
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,470
this team, this person is that cliche
10x engineer, but I don't want him

1206
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
10x engineer, but I don't want him
 

1207
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,549
10x engineer, but I don't want him
anywhere near my team because of this

1208
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
anywhere near my team because of this
 

1209
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,270
anywhere near my team because of this
attitude. Um, we worked on that. We

1210
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:45,280
attitude. Um, we worked on that. We
 

1211
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,110
attitude. Um, we worked on that. We
fine-tuned it. And the the strange part

1212
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,120
fine-tuned it. And the the strange part
 

1213
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,070
fine-tuned it. And the the strange part
is he's a really, really nice guy. It's

1214
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:50,080
is he's a really, really nice guy. It's
 

1215
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,390
is he's a really, really nice guy. It's
just this was the advice he was given

1216
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
just this was the advice he was given
 

1217
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,909
just this was the advice he was given
and he followed that advice and he

1218
00:22:53,909 --> 00:22:53,919
and he followed that advice and he
 

1219
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:56,070
and he followed that advice and he
failed so many interviews as a result.

1220
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,080
failed so many interviews as a result.
 

1221
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,230
failed so many interviews as a result.
So when I gave him the next job that he

1222
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,240
So when I gave him the next job that he
 

1223
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,669
So when I gave him the next job that he
was interviewing at was at a company

1224
00:22:59,669 --> 00:22:59,679
was interviewing at was at a company
 

1225
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,230
was interviewing at was at a company
where teamwork is very very highly

1226
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,240
where teamwork is very very highly
 

1227
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,710
where teamwork is very very highly
valued. And uh the good news is he got

1228
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:04,720
valued. And uh the good news is he got
 

1229
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,630
valued. And uh the good news is he got
the job at that company. He's now

1230
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:06,640
the job at that company. He's now
 

1231
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,470
the job at that company. He's now
working there. He doubled his salary

1232
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,480
working there. He doubled his salary
 

1233
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,390
working there. He doubled his salary
from the job he was laid off from and he

1234
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
from the job he was laid off from and he
 

1235
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,070
from the job he was laid off from and he
ended up having like about now he looks

1236
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,080
ended up having like about now he looks
 

1237
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,270
ended up having like about now he looks
back on it. He had six months of

1238
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,280
back on it. He had six months of
 

1239
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,750
back on it. He had six months of
unemployment. Um but at the time when he

1240
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:15,760
unemployment. Um but at the time when he
 

1241
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,110
unemployment. Um but at the time when he
was going through all of that, it was a

1242
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,120
was going through all of that, it was a
 

1243
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,750
was going through all of that, it was a
very very difficult time for him. So the

1244
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:19,760
very very difficult time for him. So the
 

1245
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,110
very very difficult time for him. So the
flip side of it like if you're looking

1246
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,120
flip side of it like if you're looking
 

1247
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,549
flip side of it like if you're looking
at a company and looking at the people

1248
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559
at a company and looking at the people
 

1249
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,990
at a company and looking at the people
you' be working with is very very

1250
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:24,000
you' be working with is very very
 

1251
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,070
you' be working with is very very
important. but also realize they are

1252
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:26,080
important. but also realize they are
 

1253
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,549
important. but also realize they are
looking at you in the same way. And so

1254
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:28,559
looking at you in the same way. And so
 

1255
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,510
looking at you in the same way. And so
if you've gone to um tech interview

1256
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
if you've gone to um tech interview
 

1257
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,029
if you've gone to um tech interview
coaching and they gave you that advice

1258
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,039
coaching and they gave you that advice
 

1259
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,470
coaching and they gave you that advice
to stand your ground and have a

1260
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:34,480
to stand your ground and have a
 

1261
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,310
to stand your ground and have a
backbone, it's good to do that, but

1262
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,320
backbone, it's good to do that, but
 

1263
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,470
backbone, it's good to do that, but
don't be a jerk while you're doing so.

was at Google a couple of years ago when

1362
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:23,360
was at Google a couple of years ago when
 

1363
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,710
was at Google a couple of years ago when
they had the biggest layoff they'd ever

1364
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720
they had the biggest layoff they'd ever
 

1365
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,710
they had the biggest layoff they'd ever
had. We're seeing layoffs at the likes

1366
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:26,720
had. We're seeing layoffs at the likes
 

1367
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,789
had. We're seeing layoffs at the likes
of Amazon, Microsoft, other companies

1368
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:28,799
of Amazon, Microsoft, other companies
 

1369
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,310
of Amazon, Microsoft, other companies
like that. Uh it feels that entrylevel

1370
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:32,320
like that. Uh it feels that entrylevel
 

1371
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,549
like that. Uh it feels that entrylevel
positions are scarce and I'm underlying

1372
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
positions are scarce and I'm underlying
 

1373
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,470
positions are scarce and I'm underlying
the word feels there and I want to get

1374
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:36,480
the word feels there and I want to get
 

1375
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,830
the word feels there and I want to get
into that in a little bit more detail

1376
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:37,840
into that in a little bit more detail
 

1377
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,750
into that in a little bit more detail
later. And also competition is fierce.

1378
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:41,760
later. And also competition is fierce.
 

1379
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,750
later. And also competition is fierce.
But my question is should you worry? And

1380
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,760
But my question is should you worry? And
 

1381
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,990
But my question is should you worry? And
I say no. Because if you can approach

1382
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,000
I say no. Because if you can approach
 

1383
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,070
I say no. Because if you can approach
things in the right way, if you can

1384
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
things in the right way, if you can
 

1385
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,590
things in the right way, if you can
approach the job hunting thing in the

1386
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:51,600
approach the job hunting thing in the
 

1387
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,909
approach the job hunting thing in the
right way, particularly understanding

1388
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:53,919
right way, particularly understanding
 

1389
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,149
right way, particularly understanding
how rapidly the AI landscape is

1390
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:56,159
how rapidly the AI landscape is
 

1391
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,230
how rapidly the AI landscape is
changing, then I think people with the

1392
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
changing, then I think people with the
 

1393
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,870
changing, then I think people with the
right mindset will thrive.

1394
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:00,880
right mindset will thrive.
 

1395
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,070
right mindset will thrive.
So what do I mean by that? So as Andrew

1396
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,080
So what do I mean by that? So as Andrew
 

1397
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,390
So what do I mean by that? So as Andrew
had mentioned, the AI hiring landscape

1398
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,400
had mentioned, the AI hiring landscape
 

1399
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,710
had mentioned, the AI hiring landscape
is changing because the AI industry is

1400
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:08,720
is changing because the AI industry is
 

1401
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,870
is changing because the AI industry is
changing, right? um the AI industry. I I

1402
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:12,880
changing, right? um the AI industry. I I
 

1403
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,549
changing, right? um the AI industry. I I
actually first got involved in AI back

1404
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:14,559
actually first got involved in AI back
 

1405
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,669
actually first got involved in AI back
way back in 1992. Um I worked in it for

1406
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:17,679
way back in 1992. Um I worked in it for
 

1407
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:19,350
way back in 1992. Um I worked in it for
a little while just before the AI

1408
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:19,360
a little while just before the AI
 

1409
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,750
a little while just before the AI
winter. Everything failed drastically.

1410
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:21,760
winter. Everything failed drastically.
 

1411
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,230
winter. Everything failed drastically.
Um but I got bitten by the AI bug and

1412
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,240
Um but I got bitten by the AI bug and
 

1413
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,510
Um but I got bitten by the AI bug and
then in uh 2015

1414
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:27,520
then in uh 2015
 

1415
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,590
then in uh 2015
when Google were launching TensorFlow, I

1416
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:29,600
when Google were launching TensorFlow, I
 

1417
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,669
when Google were launching TensorFlow, I
got pulled right back into it. Became

1418
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:31,679
got pulled right back into it. Became
 

1419
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,070
got pulled right back into it. Became

1422
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,000
TensorFlow, advocating TensorFlow to
 

1423
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,669

millions of people and seeing the

1424
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:37,679
millions of people and seeing the
 

1425
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,390
millions of people and seeing the
changes that happened. But along 2021

1426
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,400
changes that happened. But along 2021
 

1427
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,029
changes that happened. But along 2021
2022 we had a global pandemic. The

1428
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:45,039
2022 we had a global pandemic. The
 

1429
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,710
2022 we had a global pandemic. The
global pandemic caused a massive

1430
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:46,720
global pandemic caused a massive
 

1431
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,870
global pandemic caused a massive
industrial slowdown. This massive

1432
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:48,880
industrial slowdown. This massive
 

1433
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,950
industrial slowdown. This massive
industrial slowdown meant that companies

1434
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
industrial slowdown meant that companies
 

1435
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,190
industrial slowdown meant that companies
had to start pivoting towards things

1436
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,200
had to start pivoting towards things
 

1437
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,430
had to start pivoting towards things
that drove revenue and directly drove

1438
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,440
that drove revenue and directly drove
 

1439
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,590
that drove revenue and directly drove
revenue. And at Google, TensorFlow was

1440
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
revenue. And at Google, TensorFlow was
 

1441
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,950
revenue. And at Google, TensorFlow was
an open source product. It didn't

1442
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
an open source product. It didn't
 

1443
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,430
an open source product. It didn't
directly drive revenue. We began to

1444
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:01,440
directly drive revenue. We began to
 

1445
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,590
directly drive revenue. We began to
scale back. Every company in the world

1446
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:03,600
scale back. Every company in the world
 

1447
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,390
scale back. Every company in the world
also scaled back on hiring at this time.

1448
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:06,400
also scaled back on hiring at this time.
 

1449
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,430
also scaled back on hiring at this time.
Then we get to about 2022, 2023, what

1450
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:09,440
Then we get to about 2022, 2023, what
 

1451
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,430
Then we get to about 2022, 2023, what
happens? We begin to come out of the

1452
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:11,440
happens? We begin to come out of the
 

1453
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,390
happens? We begin to come out of the
global pandemic. We begin to realize all

1454
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:14,400
global pandemic. We begin to realize all
 

1455
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,190
global pandemic. We begin to realize all
industries have this massive log jam of

1456
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,200
industries have this massive log jam of
 

1457
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,830
industries have this massive log jam of
non-hiring that they had done or hiring

1458
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:19,840
non-hiring that they had done or hiring
 

1459
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,710
non-hiring that they had done or hiring
that they hadn't done. And we're also

1460
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720
that they hadn't done. And we're also
 

1461
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,470
that they hadn't done. And we're also
entering a time where AI was exploding

1462
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:24,480
entering a time where AI was exploding
 

1463
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,830
entering a time where AI was exploding
on the scene thanks to the work of

1464
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:25,840
on the scene thanks to the work of
 

1465
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,310
on the scene thanks to the work of
people like Andrew. The uh the world was

1466
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,320
people like Andrew. The uh the world was
 

1467
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,390
people like Andrew. The uh the world was
pivoting and changing to be AI first in

1468
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:30,400
pivoting and changing to be AI first in
 

1469
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,630
pivoting and changing to be AI first in
just about everything. And every company

1470
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
just about everything. And every company
 

1471
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,350
just about everything. And every company
needed to hire like crazy. every company

1472
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:35,360
needed to hire like crazy. every company
 

1473
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,710
needed to hire like crazy. every company
then hiring like crazy in 2022 2023

1474
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:38,720
then hiring like crazy in 2022 2023
 

1475
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,870
then hiring like crazy in 2022 2023
meant that most companies ended up

1476
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:40,880
meant that most companies ended up
 

1477
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,549
meant that most companies ended up
overhiring.

1478
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559
overhiring.
 

1479
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,909
overhiring.
Um so and what that generally meant was

1480
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:45,919
Um so and what that generally meant was
 

1481
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,190
Um so and what that generally meant was
people who were not qualified for higher

1482
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
people who were not qualified for higher
 

1483
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,669
people who were not qualified for higher
positions usually got higher positions

1484
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
positions usually got higher positions
 

1485
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,269
positions usually got higher positions
because you had to enter into a bidding

1486
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:53,279
because you had to enter into a bidding
 

1487
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,190
because you had to enter into a bidding
war just to be able to get talent. You

1488
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,200
war just to be able to get talent. You
 

1489
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,029
war just to be able to get talent. You
ended up having talent grabs and you

1490
00:27:57,029 --> 00:27:57,039
ended up having talent grabs and you
 

1491
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,470
ended up having talent grabs and you
ended up having stories like the one

1492
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:58,480
ended up having stories like the one
 

1493
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,710
ended up having stories like the one
Andrew told where it's a case of here's

1494
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:00,720
Andrew told where it's a case of here's
 

1495
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,789
Andrew told where it's a case of here's
a person with AI talent. Let's grab

1496
00:28:02,789 --> 00:28:02,799
a person with AI talent. Let's grab
 

1497
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,789
a person with AI talent. Let's grab
them. let's throw money at them. Let's

1498
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:04,799
them. let's throw money at them. Let's
 

1499
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:05,990
them. let's throw money at them. Let's
have them come work for us and then

1500
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,000
have them come work for us and then
 

1501
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,830
have them come work for us and then
we'll figure out what do we want to do.

1502
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:07,840
we'll figure out what do we want to do.
 

1503
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,870
we'll figure out what do we want to do.
So, as a result, 2022, 2023, all of this

1504
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:10,880
So, as a result, 2022, 2023, all of this
 

1505
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,750
So, as a result, 2022, 2023, all of this
massive overhiring happens because of AI

1506
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:13,760
massive overhiring happens because of AI
 

1507
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,110
massive overhiring happens because of AI
and because of the COVID log jam. And

1508
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,120
and because of the COVID log jam. And
 

1509
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,549
and because of the COVID log jam. And
then 2024, 2025 is the great wakeup,

1510
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:20,559
then 2024, 2025 is the great wakeup,
 

1511
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,149
then 2024, 2025 is the great wakeup,
right? Where a lot of companies realize

1512
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:22,159
right? Where a lot of companies realize
 

1513
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,549
right? Where a lot of companies realize
this overhiring that they had done. They

1514
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:24,559
this overhiring that they had done. They
 

1515
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,149
this overhiring that they had done. They
have ended up with a lot of people who

1516
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:26,159
have ended up with a lot of people who
 

1517
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,830
have ended up with a lot of people who
are underqualified. Oh, sorry. Yeah.

1518
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:27,840
are underqualified. Oh, sorry. Yeah.
 

1519
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,269
are underqualified. Oh, sorry. Yeah.
Underqualified for the job that they

1520
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:29,279
Underqualified for the job that they
 

1521
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,950
Underqualified for the job that they
were doing. A lot of people ended up

1522
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:30,960
were doing. A lot of people ended up
 

1523
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,310
were doing. A lot of people ended up
getting hired just because they had AI

1524
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:32,320
getting hired just because they had AI
 

1525
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,230
getting hired just because they had AI
on their resume. And there's a big

1526
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,240
on their resume. And there's a big
 

1527
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,149
on their resume. And there's a big
adjustment going on. And in the light of

1528
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:36,159
adjustment going on. And in the light of
 

1529
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,669
adjustment going on. And in the light of
this big adjustment, show just one

1530
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:37,679
this big adjustment, show just one
 

1531
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:38,870
this big adjustment, show just one
second. In the light of this big

1532
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
second. In the light of this big
 

1533
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,470
second. In the light of this big
adjustment, oh, you're not seeing my

1534
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:40,480
adjustment, oh, you're not seeing my
 

1535
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,029

1537
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,750
slides. Okay. Uh, and in the light of
this big adjustment, there we go. Uh, I

1538
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
this big adjustment, there we go. Uh, I
 

1539
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,350
this big adjustment, there we go. Uh, I
think it's cuz my power uh I'm not

1540
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,360
think it's cuz my power uh I'm not
 

1541
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,269
think it's cuz my power uh I'm not
plugged into power mains. And in the

1542
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:49,279
plugged into power mains. And in the
 

1543
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,710
plugged into power mains. And in the
light of this big adjustment, then what

1544
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:50,720
light of this big adjustment, then what
 

1545
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,950
light of this big adjustment, then what
has happened is now a lot of companies

1546
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,960
has happened is now a lot of companies
 

1547
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,230
has happened is now a lot of companies
are much more cautious about AI skills

1548
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,240
are much more cautious about AI skills
 

1549
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,909
are much more cautious about AI skills
that they're hiring. And if you're

1550
00:28:57,909 --> 00:28:57,919
that they're hiring. And if you're
 

1551
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,830
that they're hiring. And if you're
coming into that with that mindset and

1552
00:28:59,830 --> 00:28:59,840
coming into that with that mindset and
 

1553
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,950
coming into that with that mindset and
understanding that realize opportunity

1554
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:02,960
understanding that realize opportunity
 

1555
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,669
understanding that realize opportunity
is still there and opportunity is there

1556
00:29:05,669 --> 00:29:05,679
is still there and opportunity is there
 

1557
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,990
is still there and opportunity is there
massively if you approach it

1558
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:08,000
massively if you approach it
 

1559
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,070
massively if you approach it
strategically. So what I want to talk

1560
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,080
strategically. So what I want to talk
 

1561
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,990
strategically. So what I want to talk
through today is how you can do exactly

1562
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
through today is how you can do exactly
 

1563
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,750
through today is how you can do exactly
that.

1564
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:13,760
that.
 

1565
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,789
that.
So I see three pillars of success in the

1566
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:16,799
So I see three pillars of success in the
 

1567
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,310
So I see three pillars of success in the
business world uh and particularly in

1568
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:18,320
business world uh and particularly in
 

1569
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,630
business world uh and particularly in
the AI business world. And nowadays you

1570
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:20,640
the AI business world. And nowadays you
 

1571
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,070
the AI business world. And nowadays you
can't just have AI on your resume and

1572
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
can't just have AI on your resume and
 

1573
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,630
can't just have AI on your resume and
get overhired. Nowadays, not only do you

1574
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:24,640
get overhired. Nowadays, not only do you
 

1575
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,590
get overhired. Nowadays, not only do you
have to be able to tell that you have

1576
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:27,600
have to be able to tell that you have
 

1577
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,350
have to be able to tell that you have
the mindset of these three pillars of

1578
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:29,360
the mindset of these three pillars of
 

1579
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,190
the mindset of these three pillars of
success, but you also have to be able to

1580
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,200
success, but you also have to be able to
 

1581
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,669
success, but you also have to be able to
show. And to be able to show these,

1582
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:33,679
show. And to be able to show these,
 

1583
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,110
show. And to be able to show these,
there actually has never been a better

1584
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:35,120
there actually has never been a better
 

1585
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,510
there actually has never been a better
time. As Andrew demonstrated earlier on,

1586
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
time. As Andrew demonstrated earlier on,
 

1587
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,350
time. As Andrew demonstrated earlier on,
the ability to vibe code things into

1588
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,360
the ability to vibe code things into
 

1589
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,029
the ability to vibe code things into
existence. He doesn't like the word vibe

1590
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:41,039
existence. He doesn't like the word vibe
 

1591
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,710
existence. He doesn't like the word vibe
code. I kind of agree with him, but the

1592
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:42,720
code. I kind of agree with him, but the
 

1593
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,549
code. I kind of agree with him, but the
ability to prompt things into existence

1594
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:44,559
ability to prompt things into existence
 

1595
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,149
ability to prompt things into existence
or whatever the word is that we want to

1596
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:46,159
or whatever the word is that we want to
 

1597
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,110
or whatever the word is that we want to
use um allows you to be able to show

1598
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,120
use um allows you to be able to show
 

1599
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,990
use um allows you to be able to show
better than ever before. Um he was

1600
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
better than ever before. Um he was
 

1601
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,510
better than ever before. Um he was
talking earlier on about product

1602
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:53,520
talking earlier on about product
 

1603
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,510
talking earlier on about product
managers and he had this time when he

1604
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:55,520
managers and he had this time when he
 

1605
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,190
managers and he had this time when he
got engineers to be product managers and

1606
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:57,200
got engineers to be product managers and
 

1607
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,789
got engineers to be product managers and
then those engineers ended up being

1608
00:29:58,789 --> 00:29:58,799
then those engineers ended up being
 

1609
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,789
then those engineers ended up being
really bad product managers. I actually

1610
00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:00,799
really bad product managers. I actually
 

1611
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,870
really bad product managers. I actually
interviewed at Google twice and failed

1612
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:02,880
interviewed at Google twice and failed
 

1613
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,310
interviewed at Google twice and failed
twice uh despite being very successful

1614
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:06,320
twice uh despite being very successful
 

1615
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,590

taught college courses. I interviewed at

1618
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,080
taught college courses. I interviewed at
 

1619
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,590
taught college courses. I interviewed at
Google twice and failed twice because I

1620
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:13,600
Google twice and failed twice because I
 

1621
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,630
Google twice and failed twice because I
was interviewing to be a product

1622
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:14,640
was interviewing to be a product
 

1623
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,310
was interviewing to be a product
manager. uh then when I interviewed to

1624
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,320
manager. uh then when I interviewed to
 

1625
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,990
manager. uh then when I interviewed to
be an engineer they hired me and they

1626
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,000
be an engineer they hired me and they
 

1627
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,830
be an engineer they hired me and they
were like why didn't you try to join us

1628
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:19,840
were like why didn't you try to join us
 

1629

were like why didn't you try to join us
years ago you know so a lot of it is

1630
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:21,679
years ago you know so a lot of it is
 

1631
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,750
years ago you know so a lot of it is
like just you know being a good engineer

1632
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:23,760
like just you know being a good engineer
 

1633
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,669
like just you know being a good engineer
you've got the ability to do that and

1634
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:25,679
you've got the ability to do that and
 

1635
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,149
you've got the ability to do that and
show that nowadays and with that ratio

1636
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:28,159
show that nowadays and with that ratio
 

1637
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,389
show that nowadays and with that ratio

00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,320
engineering skills are also far more
 

1641
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,630

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,149
particular how to take that stuff and
put it to work. The second part of it

00:31:02,149 --> 00:31:02,159
put it to work. The second part of it
 

1667
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,990
put it to work. The second part of it
understanding in depth is really having

understanding in depth is really having
 

1669
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,470
understanding in depth is really having
your finger on the pulse of particular

1672
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:09,039
trends and where the signal to noise
 

1673
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,750
trends and where the signal to noise
ratio favors signal in those trends. And

1674
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:11,760
ratio favors signal in those trends. And
 

1675
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,950
ratio favors signal in those trends. And
I'm going to be going into that in a lot

1676
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:12,960
I'm going to be going into that in a lot
 

1677
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,430
I'm going to be going into that in a lot
more detail a little bit later.

Secondly, and also very very importantly

1680
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:17,440
Secondly, and also very very importantly

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,710
Secondly, and also very very importantly
is business focus. Um, so Andrew said

1682
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:20,720
is business focus. Um, so Andrew said
 

1683
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,310
is business focus. Um, so Andrew said
something politically incorrect earlier

1684
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,320
something politically incorrect earlier
 

1685
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,070
something politically incorrect earlier
on. I'm going to also say a similar

1686
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,080
on. I'm going to also say a similar
 

1687
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,990
on. I'm going to also say a similar
politically incorrect thing. First of

1688
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:26,000
politically incorrect thing. First of
 

1689
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,149
politically incorrect thing. First of
all, uh, hard work. Um, hard work is

1690
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:30,159
all, uh, hard work. Um, hard work is
 

1691
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:32,789
all, uh, hard work. Um, hard work is
such a nebulous term that I would say

1692
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:32,799
such a nebulous term that I would say
 

1693
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,029
such a nebulous term that I would say
that think about hard work in terms of

1694
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:35,039
that think about hard work in terms of
 

1695
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,750
that think about hard work in terms of
you are what you measure. There is the

1696
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:37,760
you are what you measure. There is the
 

1697
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,110
you are what you measure. There is the
whole trend out there. I'm trying to

1698
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,120
whole trend out there. I'm trying to
 

1699
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,149
whole trend out there. I'm trying to
remember. Was it 996 or is it 669? 996,

1700
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:42,159
remember. Was it 996 or is it 669? 996,
 

1701
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,630
remember. Was it 996 or is it 669? 996,
right? 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. 6 days a

1702
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:44,640
right? 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. 6 days a
 

1703
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,990
right? 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. 6 days a
week is a metric of hard work. It's not.

1704
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,000
week is a metric of hard work. It's not.
 

1705
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,509
week is a metric of hard work. It's not.
That's not a metric of hard work. That's

1706
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:49,519
That's not a metric of hard work. That's
 

1707
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,310
That's not a metric of hard work. That's
a metric of time spent. Um, so I would

1708
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
a metric of time spent. Um, so I would
 

1709
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,070
a metric of time spent. Um, so I would
encourage everybody in the same way as

1710
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,080
encourage everybody in the same way as
 

1711
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,470
encourage everybody in the same way as
Andrew did to think about hard work. But

1712
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
Andrew did to think about hard work. But
 

1713
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,789
Andrew did to think about hard work. But
h what hard work is is how you measure

1714
00:31:58,789 --> 00:31:58,799
h what hard work is is how you measure
 

1715
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,950
h what hard work is is how you measure
that hard work. You know, you can work

1716
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:00,960
that hard work. You know, you can work
 

1717
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,029
that hard work. You know, you can work
eight hours a day and be incredibly

1718
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:03,039
eight hours a day and be incredibly
 

1719
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,190
eight hours a day and be incredibly
productive. You can work six hours a day

1720
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:05,200
productive. You can work six hours a day
 

1721
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,509
productive. You can work six hours a day
and be incredibly productive. But it's

1722
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:07,519
and be incredibly productive. But it's
 

1723
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,669
and be incredibly productive. But it's
the metric of how hard you work and how

1724
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:09,679
the metric of how hard you work and how
 

1725
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,830
the metric of how hard you work and how
you measure that. I personally measure

1726
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:11,840
you measure that. I personally measure
 

1727
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,149
you measure that. I personally measure
that from output, things that I have

1728
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:14,159
that from output, things that I have
 

1729
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,350
that from output, things that I have
created in the time that I spent. Um I I

1730
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,360
created in the time that I spent. Um I I
 

1731
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,669
created in the time that I spent. Um I I
joke a lot, but it's true that um I've

1732
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:19,679
joke a lot, but it's true that um I've
 

1733
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,669
joke a lot, but it's true that um I've
written a lot of books. Uh Andrew held

1734
00:32:21,669 --> 00:32:21,679
written a lot of books. Uh Andrew held
 

1735
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:23,669
written a lot of books. Uh Andrew held
up one that one that he held up that um

1736
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:23,679
up one that one that he held up that um
 

1737
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,070
up one that one that he held up that um
he helped me write a little bit. Um I

1738
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:26,080
he helped me write a little bit. Um I
 

1739
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,590
he helped me write a little bit. Um I
actually wrote that book in about two

1740
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:27,600
actually wrote that book in about two
 

1741
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,909
actually wrote that book in about two
months. And people say, "Well, how how

1742
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:29,919
months. And people say, "Well, how how
 

1743
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,509
months. And people say, "Well, how how
do you have time with your jobs and all

1744
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:31,519
do you have time with your jobs and all
 

1745
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,710
do you have time with your jobs and all
these kind of things? How do you you

1746
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:32,720
these kind of things? How do you you
 

1747
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,710
these kind of things? How do you you
must work like 16 hours a day in order

1748
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:34,720
must work like 16 hours a day in order
 

1749
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,630
must work like 16 hours a day in order
to be able to do this?" But I actually

1750
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,640
to be able to do this?" But I actually
 

1751
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,389
to be able to do this?" But I actually
um the key to me being able to write

1752
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:38,399
um the key to me being able to write
 

1753
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,269
um the key to me being able to write
books is uh baseball. Any baseball fans

1754
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:41,279
books is uh baseball. Any baseball fans
 

1755
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,230
books is uh baseball. Any baseball fans
here? Um so I I love baseball, but if

1756
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:44,240
here? Um so I I love baseball, but if
 

1757
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,830
here? Um so I I love baseball, but if
you sit down and try to watch baseball

1758
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:45,840
you sit down and try to watch baseball
 

1759
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,590
you sit down and try to watch baseball
on TV, a match can take like three and a

1760
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,600
on TV, a match can take like three and a
 

1761
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,669
on TV, a match can take like three and a
half or four hours. So all of my writing

1762
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:49,679
half or four hours. So all of my writing
 

1763
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,669
half or four hours. So all of my writing
I tend to do in baseball season. So I'm

1764
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:51,679
I tend to do in baseball season. So I'm
 

1765
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:53,190
I tend to do in baseball season. So I'm
like if I'm going to sit down, I like

1766
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:53,200
like if I'm going to sit down, I like
 

1767
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,190
like if I'm going to sit down, I like
the Mariners from I'm from Seattle. I

1768
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,200
the Mariners from I'm from Seattle. I
 

1769
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,350
the Mariners from I'm from Seattle. I
like the Dodgers.

1770
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:57,360
like the Dodgers.
 

1771
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,750
like the Dodgers.
Nobody booed. Okay, good. Uh and you

1772
00:32:59,750 --> 00:32:59,760
Nobody booed. Okay, good. Uh and you
 

1773
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,190
Nobody booed. Okay, good. Uh and you
know, so like usually one of those is

1774
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,200
know, so like usually one of those is
 

1775
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,110
know, so like usually one of those is
going to be playing at 7:00 at night. So

1776
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,120
going to be playing at 7:00 at night. So
 

1777
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,710
going to be playing at 7:00 at night. So
instead of sitting in front of the TV

1778
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:04,720
instead of sitting in front of the TV
 

1779
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,630
instead of sitting in front of the TV
just like watching baseball mindlessly,

1780
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:06,640
just like watching baseball mindlessly,
 

1781
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,990
just like watching baseball mindlessly,
I'll actually be writing a book while

1782
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
I'll actually be writing a book while
 

1783
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,350
I'll actually be writing a book while
baseball's on in the background. It's a

1784
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,360
baseball's on in the background. It's a
 

1785
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,430
baseball's on in the background. It's a
very slowmoving game. This is something

1786
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:11,440
very slowmoving game. This is something
 

1787
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,350
very slowmoving game. This is something
like that's the hard work, you know, in

1788
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:13,360
like that's the hard work, you know, in
 

1789
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,509
like that's the hard work, you know, in
this case. And I would encourage you to

1790
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:15,519
this case. And I would encourage you to
 

1791
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,389
this case. And I would encourage you to
try to find areas where you can work

1792
00:33:18,389 --> 00:33:18,399
try to find areas where you can work
 

1793
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,350
try to find areas where you can work
hard and produce output. And that's the

1794
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,360
hard and produce output. And that's the
 

1795
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,870
hard and produce output. And that's the
second pillar here is that business

1796
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
second pillar here is that business
 

1797
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,750
second pillar here is that business
focus. The output that you produce to

1798
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:25,760
focus. The output that you produce to
 

1799
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,470
focus. The output that you produce to
align that output with the business

1800
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:28,480
align that output with the business
 

1801
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,990
align that output with the business
focus that you want to have and with the

1802
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:30,000
focus that you want to have and with the
 

1803
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,070
focus that you want to have and with the
work that you want to do. There's an old

1804
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,080
work that you want to do. There's an old
 

1805
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,710
work that you want to do. There's an old
saying, don't dress for the job you

1806
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:34,720
saying, don't dress for the job you
 

1807
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,110
saying, don't dress for the job you
have, dress for the one you want. I

1808
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:37,120
have, dress for the one you want. I
 

1809
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,750
have, dress for the one you want. I
would say a a new angle on that saying

1810
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:39,760
would say a a new angle on that saying
 

1811
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,909
would say a a new angle on that saying
would be don't let your output be for

1812
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:41,919
would be don't let your output be for
 

1813
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,750
would be don't let your output be for
the job you have, let your output be for

1814
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:43,760
the job you have, let your output be for
 

1815
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,909
the job you have, let your output be for
the job you want. And if I go back to

1816
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:45,919
the job you want. And if I go back to
 

1817
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:47,509
the job you want. And if I go back to
when I spoke about I failed twice at

1818
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:47,519
when I spoke about I failed twice at
 

1819
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,590
when I spoke about I failed twice at
Google to get in the third time when I

1820
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:49,600
Google to get in the third time when I
 

1821
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,789
Google to get in the third time when I
got in um I had actually decided to do

1822
00:33:52,789 --> 00:33:52,799
got in um I had actually decided to do
 

1823
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,710
got in um I had actually decided to do
to approach this in a different way and

1824
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:54,720
to approach this in a different way and
 

1825
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,310
to approach this in a different way and
I was interviewing at the time for their

1826
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:56,320
I was interviewing at the time for their
 

1827
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,909
I was interviewing at the time for their
cloud team. uh they were just really

1828
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:57,919
cloud team. uh they were just really
 

1829
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,310
cloud team. uh they were just really
launching cloud um and I had just

1830
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:00,320
launching cloud um and I had just
 

1831
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,950
launching cloud um and I had just
written a book on Java and so I decided

1832
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:02,960
written a book on Java and so I decided
 

1833
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,630
written a book on Java and so I decided
to see what I could do with Java in

1834
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:04,640
to see what I could do with Java in
 

1835
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,789
to see what I could do with Java in
their cloud I ended up writing a Java

1836
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:06,799
their cloud I ended up writing a Java
 

1837
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,109
their cloud I ended up writing a Java
application that ran in their cloud for

1838
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:09,119
application that ran in their cloud for
 

1839
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,190
application that ran in their cloud for
predicting stock prices using technical

1840
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,200
predicting stock prices using technical
 

1841
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,030
predicting stock prices using technical
analytics and all that kind of stuff.

1842
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,040
analytics and all that kind of stuff.
 

1843
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,109
analytics and all that kind of stuff.
Um, and when I got to the interview,

1844
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:15,119
Um, and when I got to the interview,
 

1845
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,790
Um, and when I got to the interview,
instead of them asking me stupid

1846
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:16,800
instead of them asking me stupid
 

1847
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,470
instead of them asking me stupid
questions like, "How many golf balls can

1848
00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:18,480
questions like, "How many golf balls can
 

1849
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,190
questions like, "How many golf balls can
fit in a bus?" You know, they they saw

1850
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:21,200
fit in a bus?" You know, they they saw
 

1851
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,430
fit in a bus?" You know, they they saw
this code. I had put this code. I

1852
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,440
this code. I had put this code. I
 

1853
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,510
this code. I had put this code. I
remember I was producing output for the

1854
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:25,520
remember I was producing output for the
 

1855
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,750
remember I was producing output for the
job I wanted. I put this code on my

1856
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:27,760
job I wanted. I put this code on my
 

1857
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,550
job I wanted. I put this code on my
resume and my entire interview loop was

1858
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:30,560
resume and my entire interview loop was
 

1859
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,710
resume and my entire interview loop was
them asking me about my code, right? So,

1860
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:32,720
them asking me about my code, right? So,
 

1861
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,510
them asking me about my code, right? So,
it put the power on me. It gave me the

1862
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,520
it put the power on me. It gave me the
 

1863
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,829
it put the power on me. It gave me the
power to communicate about things that I

1864
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:37,839
power to communicate about things that I
 

1865
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,990
power to communicate about things that I
knew as opposed to going in blind to

1866
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:42,000
knew as opposed to going in blind to
 

1867
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,550
knew as opposed to going in blind to
somebody asking me random questions in

1868
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
somebody asking me random questions in
 

1869
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,909
somebody asking me random questions in
the hope that I'll be able to answer

1870
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:45,919
the hope that I'll be able to answer
 

1871
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,589
the hope that I'll be able to answer
them. And it's the same thing I would

1872
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:47,599
them. And it's the same thing I would
 

1873
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,230
them. And it's the same thing I would
say in the in the AI world, the uh the

1874
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:50,240
say in the in the AI world, the uh the
 

1875
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,470
say in the in the AI world, the uh the
business focus, the ability for you now

1876
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:52,480
business focus, the ability for you now
 

1877
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,869
business focus, the ability for you now
to prompt code into existence, to prompt

1878
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:54,879
to prompt code into existence, to prompt
 

1879
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,869
to prompt code into existence, to prompt

products into existence, you know, and

00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,270
products into existence, you know, and
if you can build those products and line

1882
00:34:59,270 --> 00:34:59,280
if you can build those products and line
 

1883
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,510
if you can build those products and line
them up with the thing that it is that

00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:01,520
them up with the thing that it is that
 

1885
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,030
them up with the thing that it is that
you want to do, be it at Google or a

1886
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,040
you want to do, be it at Google or a
 

1887
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,710
you want to do, be it at Google or a
meta or a startup or any of those kind

1888
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:04,720
meta or a startup or any of those kind
 

1889
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,710
meta or a startup or any of those kind
of things and have that in-depth

1890
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:06,720
of things and have that in-depth
 

1891
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,870
of things and have that in-depth
understanding not just of your code, but

1892
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:08,880
understanding not just of your code, but
 

1893
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,950
understanding not just of your code, but
how it aligns to that business. This is

1894
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:10,960
how it aligns to that business. This is
 

1895
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,710
how it aligns to that business. This is
a pillar of success in this time and

1896
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:12,720
a pillar of success in this time and
 

1897
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,790
a pillar of success in this time and
age. And I will also argue that even

1898
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:14,800
age. And I will also argue that even
 

1899
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,310
age. And I will also argue that even
though it looks like the signals look

1900
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:16,320
though it looks like the signals look
 

1901
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,670
though it looks like the signals look
like there aren't a lot of jobs out

1902
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:17,680
like there aren't a lot of jobs out
 

1903
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,069
like there aren't a lot of jobs out
there, there are. What there aren't a

1904
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:20,079
there, there are. What there aren't a
 

1905
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,069
there, there are. What there aren't a
lot of is a good combination of jobs and

1906
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:22,079
lot of is a good combination of jobs and
 

1907
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:24,630
lot of is a good combination of jobs and
people to match them. And then of course

1908
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:24,640
people to match them. And then of course
 

1909
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,109
people to match them. And then of course
the this bias towards delivery. Ideas

1910
00:35:27,109 --> 00:35:27,119
the this bias towards delivery. Ideas
 

1911
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,910
the this bias towards delivery. Ideas
are cheap. Execution is everything. Um

1912
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:29,920
are cheap. Execution is everything. Um
 

1913
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,829
are cheap. Execution is everything. Um
I've interviewed many many people who

1914
00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:31,839
I've interviewed many many people who
 

1915
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,710
I've interviewed many many people who
came in with very very fluffy ideas and

1916
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:34,720
came in with very very fluffy ideas and
 

1917
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,630
came in with very very fluffy ideas and
no way to be able to ground them. I've

1918
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:36,640
no way to be able to ground them. I've
 

1919
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,230
no way to be able to ground them. I've
interviewed people who came in with

1920
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,240
interviewed people who came in with
 

1921
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,390
interviewed people who came in with
halfbaked ideas that they grounded very

1922
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:40,400
halfbaked ideas that they grounded very
 

1923
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,230
halfbaked ideas that they grounded very
very well. Guess which one's got the

1924
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
very well. Guess which one's got the
 

1925
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,390
very well. Guess which one's got the
job. Right? So, I would say these three

1926
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:44,400
job. Right? So, I would say these three
 

1927
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,870
job. Right? So, I would say these three
things, understanding in depth of the

1928
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:46,880
things, understanding in depth of the
 

1929
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,829
things, understanding in depth of the
academics behind AI, of the um the

1930
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:49,839
academics behind AI, of the um the
 

1931
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,910
academics behind AI, of the um the
practicalities behind AI and the things

1932
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:51,920
practicalities behind AI and the things
 

1933
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,630
practicalities behind AI and the things
that you need to do, business focus,

1934
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:54,640
that you need to do, business focus,
 

1935
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,790
that you need to do, business focus,
focusing on delivery for the business,

1936
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:56,800
focusing on delivery for the business,
 

1937
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,069
focusing on delivery for the business,
understanding what the business needs

1938
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:58,079
understanding what the business needs
 

1939
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,910
understanding what the business needs
and being able to deliver for that. And

1940
00:35:59,910 --> 00:35:59,920
and being able to deliver for that. And
 

1941
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,430
and being able to deliver for that. And
again, that bias towards delivery.

1942
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:03,440
again, that bias towards delivery.
 

1943
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,349
again, that bias towards delivery.
So, uh quick pivot. What's it actually

1944
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:05,359
So, uh quick pivot. What's it actually
 

1945
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:08,150
So, uh quick pivot. What's it actually
like working in AI right now? It's

1946
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,160
like working in AI right now? It's
 

1947
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,310
like working in AI right now? It's
interesting. Okay. Um, so as recently as

1948
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,320
interesting. Okay. Um, so as recently as
 

1949
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,470
interesting. Okay. Um, so as recently as
like two or three years ago working in

1950
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:14,480
like two or three years ago working in
 

1951
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,030
like two or three years ago working in
AOI was if you can do a thing, you're

1952
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:17,040
AOI was if you can do a thing, you're
 

1953
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,670
AOI was if you can do a thing, you're
great. Um, if you can build an image

1954
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:19,680
great. Um, if you can build an image
 

1955
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,230
great. Um, if you can build an image
classifier, you're golden. We'll throw

1956
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:22,240
classifier, you're golden. We'll throw
 

1957
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,710
classifier, you're golden. We'll throw
six figures salaries and massive stock

1958
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:24,720
six figures salaries and massive stock
 

1959
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,470
six figures salaries and massive stock
benefits at you. Unfortunately, that's

1960
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:26,480
benefits at you. Unfortunately, that's
 

1961
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,030
benefits at you. Unfortunately, that's
not the case anymore, right? It's really

1962
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,040
not the case anymore, right? It's really
 

1963
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,430
not the case anymore, right? It's really
a lot of today, what you'll see is the P

1964
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:31,440
a lot of today, what you'll see is the P
 

1965
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,910
a lot of today, what you'll see is the P
word production. What can you do for

1966
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:33,920
word production. What can you do for
 

1967
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,589
word production. What can you do for
production? What can you do? Um if it's

1968
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:37,599
production? What can you do? Um if it's
 

1969
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,630
production? What can you do? Um if it's
building new models, if it's optimizing

1970
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:40,640
building new models, if it's optimizing
 

1971
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,390
building new models, if it's optimizing
models, if it's understanding users, uh

1972
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:44,400
models, if it's understanding users, uh
 

1973
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,230
models, if it's understanding users, uh
UX is really really important.

1974
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,240
UX is really really important.
 

1975
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,470
UX is really really important.
Everything is geared towards production.

1976
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:48,480
Everything is geared towards production.
 

1977
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,710
Everything is geared towards production.
Everything is biased towards production.

1978
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:50,720
Everything is biased towards production.
 

1979
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,630
Everything is biased towards production.
The history that I told you about like

1980
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:52,640
The history that I told you about like
 

1981
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,150
The history that I told you about like
you know going from the pandemic into

1982
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,160
you know going from the pandemic into
 

1983
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,710
you know going from the pandemic into
the overhiring phase that we'd had um

1984
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:56,720
the overhiring phase that we'd had um
 

1985
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,190
the overhiring phase that we'd had um
you know the the businesses have pulled

1986
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,200
you know the the businesses have pulled
 

1987
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,910
you know the the businesses have pulled
back and are optimized towards the

1988
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:01,920
back and are optimized towards the
 

1989
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,910
back and are optimized towards the
bottom line. I have an old saying that

1990
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:03,920
bottom line. I have an old saying that
 

1991
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,510
bottom line. I have an old saying that
the bottom line is that the bottom line

1992
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:05,520
the bottom line is that the bottom line
 

1993
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,510
the bottom line is that the bottom line
is the bottom line. And this is the

1994
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:07,520
is the bottom line. And this is the
 

1995
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,030
is the bottom line. And this is the
environment that we're in today. And if

1996
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,040
environment that we're in today. And if
 

1997
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,190
environment that we're in today. And if
you can come in with that mindset when

1998
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:11,200
you can come in with that mindset when
 

1999
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,589
you can come in with that mindset when
you're talking with companies, that's

2000
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:13,599
you're talking with companies, that's
 

2001
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,390
you're talking with companies, that's
one of the keys to open the door.

2002
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:16,400
one of the keys to open the door.
 

2003
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,750
one of the keys to open the door.
One of the things I've seen in the field

2004
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:17,760
One of the things I've seen in the field
 

2005
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,430
One of the things I've seen in the field
has been maturing from it used to be

2006
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:19,440
has been maturing from it used to be
 

2007
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,950
has been maturing from it used to be
really nice that we could do cool things

2008
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:20,960
really nice that we could do cool things
 

2009
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,270
really nice that we could do cool things
and we could build cool things. Now it's

2010
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:23,280
and we could build cool things. Now it's
 

2011
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,750
and we could build cool things. Now it's
really build useful things. Those useful

2012
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:25,760
really build useful things. Those useful
 

2013
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,270
really build useful things. Those useful
things can be to cool too by the way.

2014
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:27,280
things can be to cool too by the way.
 

2015
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,030
things can be to cool too by the way.
And the results of them can be cool. and

2016
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,040
And the results of them can be cool. and
 

2017
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,430
And the results of them can be cool. and
the changes that we see that come about

2018
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,440
the changes that we see that come about
 

2019
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,190
the changes that we see that come about
as a result of delivering them can be

2020
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:33,200
as a result of delivering them can be
 

2021
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,430
as a result of delivering them can be
cool. Um so it's not just coolness for

2022
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:35,440
cool. Um so it's not just coolness for
 

2023
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,430
cool. Um so it's not just coolness for
coolness sake but to really you know to

2024
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:39,440
coolness sake but to really you know to
 

2025
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,310
coolness sake but to really you know to
focus on delivery focus on um being able

2026
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:42,320
focus on delivery focus on um being able
 

2027
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,150
focus on delivery focus on um being able
to provide value and then the coolness

2028
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:44,160
to provide value and then the coolness
 

2029
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,510
to provide value and then the coolness
will follow I guess what I'm trying to

2030
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,520
will follow I guess what I'm trying to
 

2031
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,349
will follow I guess what I'm trying to
argue.

2032
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:47,359
argue.
 

2033
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,910
argue.
So four realities number one

Now let me I'm going to be a little bit

2040
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:55,680
Now let me I'm going to be a little bit
 

2041
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,430
Now let me I'm going to be a little bit
politically incorrect here again for a

2042
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
politically incorrect here again for a
 

2043

2047
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,790
working like I said for most of the last
35 years in tech. I would say for most

2048
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:04,800
35 years in tech. I would say for most
 

2049
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,750
35 years in tech. I would say for most
of the last 10 years a lot of large

2050
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:07,760
of the last 10 years a lot of large
 

2051
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,390
of the last 10 years a lot of large
companies particularly in Silicon Valley

2052
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:10,400
companies particularly in Silicon Valley

to work was bringing the things that
 

2065
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,310
to work was bringing the things that
they care about outside of work. Um and

they care about outside of work. Um and
 

2067
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,870
they care about outside of work. Um and
that led to a lot of activism within

2068
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:30,880
that led to a lot of activism within
 

2069
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,870
that led to a lot of activism within
companies. Now please let me underline

2070
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:34,880
companies. Now please let me underline
 

2071
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,069
companies. Now please let me underline
this. There is nothing wrong with

is absolutely nothing wrong with that.
 

2081
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,589
is absolutely nothing wrong with that.
But the overindexing on that has in my

2082
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:49,599
But the overindexing on that has in my
 

2083
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,910
But the overindexing on that has in my
experience has led to a lot of companies

2084
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:51,920
experience has led to a lot of companies
 

2085
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,910
experience has led to a lot of companies
getting trapped by having to support

2086
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:53,920
getting trapped by having to support
 

2087
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,870
getting trapped by having to support
activism above business. Um I you've

activism above business. Um I you've
 

2089
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,790
activism above business. Um I you've
probably seen an example about two years

2090
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:58,800
probably seen an example about two years
 

2091
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,750
probably seen an example about two years
ago of where activists in Google broke

2092
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:01,760
ago of where activists in Google broke

into the Google Cloud heads office
because they were protesting a c a

00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:07,119
because they were protesting a c a

country that uh Google Cloud were doing
 

2099
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,870
country that uh Google Cloud were doing
business with. They broke into his

office. They had a sitin in his office
 

2103
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,870
office. They had a sitin in his office
and they they used the bathroom all over

2104
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:14,880
and they they used the bathroom all over
 

2105
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,630
and they they used the bathroom all over
his desk and stuff like that. This is

his desk and stuff like that. This is
 

2107
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,349
his desk and stuff like that. This is
where activism got out of hand. And as a

2108
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:19,359
where activism got out of hand. And as a
 

2109
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,470
where activism got out of hand. And as a
result, the unfortunate truth is the

2110
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:22,480
result, the unfortunate truth is the
 

2111
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,630
result, the unfortunate truth is the
good signals in that activism are now

2112
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:24,640
good signals in that activism are now
 

2113
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,589
good signals in that activism are now
being lost because of those actions.

2114
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:27,599
being lost because of those actions.
 

2115
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,030
being lost because of those actions.
People are being laid off. People are

2116
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,040
People are being laid off. People are
 

2117
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,829
People are being laid off. People are
losing jobs. Activism is being stifled.

2118
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:31,839
losing jobs. Activism is being stifled.
 

2119
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,670
losing jobs. Activism is being stifled.
Um, and business focus has become

2120
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:33,680
Um, and business focus has become
 

2121
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,510
Um, and business focus has become
non-negotiable. There's a bit of a

2122
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:35,520
non-negotiable. There's a bit of a
 

2123
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,430
non-negotiable. There's a bit of a
pendulum swing going on. And the

2124
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:37,440
pendulum swing going on. And the
 

2125
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,829
pendulum swing going on. And the
pendulum that had swung too far towards

2126
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:39,839
pendulum that had swung too far towards
 

2127
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,589
pendulum that had swung too far towards
allowing people to bring their full

2128
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:41,599
allowing people to bring their full
 

2129
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,990
allowing people to bring their full
selves to work is now swinging back in

2130
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,000
selves to work is now swinging back in
 

2131
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,470
selves to work is now swinging back in
the other direction. We might blame the

2132
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:46,480
the other direction. We might blame the
 

2133
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,990
the other direction. We might blame the
person in the White House and all that

2134
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,000
person in the White House and all that
 

2135
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,750
person in the White House and all that
for for these kind of things but it's

2136
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:49,760
for for these kind of things but it's
 

2137
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,910
for for these kind of things but it's
not solely that it is that ongoing

2138
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:51,920
not solely that it is that ongoing
 

2139
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,829
not solely that it is that ongoing
pendulum there then and I think it's an

2140
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:53,839
pendulum there then and I think it's an
 

2141
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,750
pendulum there then and I think it's an
important part of it is that you have to

2142
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:55,760
important part of it is that you have to
 

2143
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,670
important part of it is that you have to
realize going into companies now that

2144
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:57,680
realize going into companies now that
 

2145
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,190
realize going into companies now that
business focus is absolutely

2146
00:39:59,190 --> 00:39:59,200
business focus is absolutely
 

2147
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,190
business focus is absolutely
non-negotiable.

2148
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200
non-negotiable.
 

2149
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,270
non-negotiable.
Secondly, risk mitigation is part of the

2150
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:03,280
Secondly, risk mitigation is part of the
 

2151
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,750
Secondly, risk mitigation is part of the
job. Uh and I think a very important

2152
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:05,760
job. Uh and I think a very important
 

2153
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,550
job. Uh and I think a very important
part of any job particularly with AI. I

2154
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:08,560
part of any job particularly with AI. I
 

2155
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,310
part of any job particularly with AI. I
think if you can come into AI with a

2156
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:10,320
think if you can come into AI with a
 

2157
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,790
think if you can come into AI with a
focus and a mindset around understanding

2158
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:12,800
focus and a mindset around understanding
 

2159
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,910
focus and a mindset around understanding
the risks of transforming a particular

2160
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:15,920
the risks of transforming a particular
 

2161
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,790
the risks of transforming a particular

2164
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:22,079
one um and to help mitigate those risks
 

2165
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,870
one um and to help mitigate those risks
I think is really really powerful and I

those risks and here's the mindset
behind that. Uh the third part is

00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:42,320
behind that. Uh the third part is

you know let's make sure that the AI
 

2191
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,910
you know let's make sure that the AI
works for everybody uh to a definition

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,790
works for everybody uh to a definition
of let's make sure that the AI works

2194
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:00,800
of let's make sure that the AI works
 

2195
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,309
of let's make sure that the AI works
let's make sure that it drives the

2196
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
let's make sure that it drives the
 

2197
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,550
let's make sure that it drives the
business and then let's make sure that

2198
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:04,560
business and then let's make sure that
 

2199
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,950
business and then let's make sure that
it works for everybody. often that has

2200
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:06,960
it works for everybody. often that has
 

2201
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,790
it works for everybody. often that has
been inverted over the last few years

2202
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:08,800
been inverted over the last few years
 

2203
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,390
been inverted over the last few years
and that has led to some famous

2204
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,400
and that has led to some famous
 

2205
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,550
and that has led to some famous
documented disasters. Let me share one

2206
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:12,560
documented disasters. Let me share one
 

2207
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,630
documented disasters. Let me share one
with you.

2208
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:14,640
with you.
 

2209
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,349
with you.
Uh let's see I have lots of windows

2210
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:17,359
Uh let's see I have lots of windows
 

2211
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:20,470
Uh let's see I have lots of windows
open. Okay. Uh anybody know everybody

2212
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:20,480
open. Okay. Uh anybody know everybody
 

2213
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,230
open. Okay. Uh anybody know everybody
knows image generation right? Text to

00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,240
knows image generation right? Text to
 

2215
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,750

2217
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,589

these were things that happened a couple

2218
00:41:27,589 --> 00:41:27,599
these were things that happened a couple
 

2219
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,550
these were things that happened a couple
years ago with Gemini.

2220
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:30,560
years ago with Gemini.
 

2221
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,790
years ago with Gemini.
So with Gemini, I was doing some testing

2222
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:32,800
So with Gemini, I was doing some testing
 

2223
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,790
So with Gemini, I was doing some testing
around this one and I was working

2224
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:34,800
around this one and I was working
 

2225
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,589
around this one and I was working
heavily on responsible AI.

2226
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:37,599
heavily on responsible AI.
 

2227
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,910
heavily on responsible AI.
And part of responsible AI is you want

2228
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:39,920
And part of responsible AI is you want
 

2229
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,870
And part of responsible AI is you want
to be representative of people. And when

2230
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:42,880
to be representative of people. And when
 

2231
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,550
to be representative of people. And when
you're building something like if you're

2232
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:44,560
you're building something like if you're
 

2233
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,829
you're building something like if you're
a Google and you're indexing

2234
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:45,839
a Google and you're indexing
 

2235
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,910
a Google and you're indexing
information, you really want to make

2236
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:47,920
information, you really want to make
 

2237
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,910
information, you really want to make
sure that you don't reinforce negative

2238
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:49,920
sure that you don't reinforce negative
 

2239
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,550
sure that you don't reinforce negative
biases. And if you're generating images,

2240
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:52,560
biases. And if you're generating images,
 

2241
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,950
biases. And if you're generating images,
it's very to easy to reinforce negative

2242
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:54,960
it's very to easy to reinforce negative
 

2243
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,190
it's very to easy to reinforce negative
biases. So for example, if I said, give

2244
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,200
biases. So for example, if I said, give
 

2245
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,270
biases. So for example, if I said, give
me an image of a doctor, right? If the

2246
00:41:59,270 --> 00:41:59,280
me an image of a doctor, right? If the
 

2247
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,349
me an image of a doctor, right? If the
training set primarily has men as

2248
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:01,359
training set primarily has men as
 

2249
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,510
training set primarily has men as
doctors, it's more likely to give a man.

2250
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:03,520
doctors, it's more likely to give a man.
 

2251
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,589
doctors, it's more likely to give a man.
If I say, "Give me an image of a nurse."

2252
00:42:05,589 --> 00:42:05,599
If I say, "Give me an image of a nurse."
 

2253
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,190
If I say, "Give me an image of a nurse."
If the training set more likely to have

2254
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:07,200
If the training set more likely to have
 

2255
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,630
If the training set more likely to have
women as nurses, it's more likely to

2256
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:08,640
women as nurses, it's more likely to
 

2257
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,390
women as nurses, it's more likely to
give me an image of a woman. But that's

2258
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:10,400
give me an image of a woman. But that's
 

2259
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,109
give me an image of a woman. But that's
reinforcing a negative stereotype. So, I

2260
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:13,119
reinforcing a negative stereotype. So, I
 

2261
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,150
reinforcing a negative stereotype. So, I
wanted to do a test of how Google were

2262
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,160
wanted to do a test of how Google were
 

2263
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,349
wanted to do a test of how Google were
trying to overcome that given that these

2264
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:19,359
trying to overcome that given that these
 

2265
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:21,589
trying to overcome that given that these
negative biases are already in the

2266
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:21,599
negative biases are already in the
 

2267
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,069
negative biases are already in the
training set. So, I said, "Okay, here's

2268
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:24,079
training set. So, I said, "Okay, here's
 

2269
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,069
training set. So, I said, "Okay, here's
a prompt where I said,"Give me a young

2270
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:26,079
a prompt where I said,"Give me a young
 

2271
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,670
a prompt where I said,"Give me a young
Asian woman in a cornfield wearing a

2272
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:27,680
Asian woman in a cornfield wearing a
 

2273
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,109
Asian woman in a cornfield wearing a
summer dress and a straw hat looking

2274
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:29,119
summer dress and a straw hat looking
 

2275
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:31,190
summer dress and a straw hat looking
intently at her iPhone." And it gave me

2276
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:31,200
intently at her iPhone." And it gave me
 

2277
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,710
intently at her iPhone." And it gave me
these beautiful images. It did a really

2278
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:32,720
these beautiful images. It did a really
 

2279
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,470
these beautiful images. It did a really
nice job.

2280
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:34,480
nice job.
 

2281
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,190
nice job.
Okay. And I said, "This is a virtual

2282
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,200
Okay. And I said, "This is a virtual
 

2283
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,470
Okay. And I said, "This is a virtual
actress I've been working with. I'll

2284
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:38,480
actress I've been working with. I'll
 

2285
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,230
actress I've been working with. I'll
share that in a moment." And I say,

2286
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:40,240
share that in a moment." And I say,
 

2287
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,470
share that in a moment." And I say,
"Okay, what if I ask for an Indian one?"

2288
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:44,480
"Okay, what if I ask for an Indian one?"
 

2289
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,349
"Okay, what if I ask for an Indian one?"
So, I said, "Okay." Whoops. A young

2290
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:47,359
So, I said, "Okay." Whoops. A young
 

2291
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,430
So, I said, "Okay." Whoops. A young
Indian woman. Same prompt. And it gave

2292
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:49,440
Indian woman. Same prompt. And it gave
 

2293
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,190
Indian woman. Same prompt. And it gave
me beautiful images of a young Indian

2294
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:51,200
me beautiful images of a young Indian
 

2295
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,630
me beautiful images of a young Indian
woman.

2296
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:52,640
woman.
 

2297
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,670
woman.
Then I was like, "Okay, what if I want

2298
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
Then I was like, "Okay, what if I want
 

2299
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,150
Then I was like, "Okay, what if I want
her to be black?"

2300
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:58,160
her to be black?"
 

2301
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,309
her to be black?"
For some reason, it only gave me three.

2302
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:00,319
For some reason, it only gave me three.
 

2303
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,470
For some reason, it only gave me three.
I'm not sure why, but it still adeared

2304
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:02,480
I'm not sure why, but it still adeared
 

2305
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,790
I'm not sure why, but it still adeared
to the prompt. So, the responsibility

2306
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:04,800
to the prompt. So, the responsibility
 

2307
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,870
to the prompt. So, the responsibility
was like looking really, really good.

2308
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:06,880
was like looking really, really good.
 

2309
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,109
was like looking really, really good.
So, then I asked it to give me a Latina.

2310
00:43:11,109 --> 00:43:11,119
So, then I asked it to give me a Latina.
 

2311
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,150
So, then I asked it to give me a Latina.
Latina. It gave me four. But, yep, she

2312
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,160
Latina. It gave me four. But, yep, she
 

2313
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,390
Latina. It gave me four. But, yep, she
looks pretty Latina. Maybe the one on

2314
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:16,400
looks pretty Latina. Maybe the one on
 

2315
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,069
looks pretty Latina. Maybe the one on
the bottom left looks a little bit like

2316
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:18,079
the bottom left looks a little bit like
 

2317
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,550
the bottom left looks a little bit like
Hermione Granger. Uh but on the whole

2318
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:20,560
Hermione Granger. Uh but on the whole
 

2319
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,190
Hermione Granger. Uh but on the whole
looks pretty good. Then I asked it to

2320
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:23,200
looks pretty good. Then I asked it to
 

2321
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,270
looks pretty good. Then I asked it to
give me a Caucasian. What do you think

2322
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:25,280
give me a Caucasian. What do you think
 

2323
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,790
give me a Caucasian. What do you think
happened?

2324
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:26,800
happened?
 

2325
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,630
happened?
While I understand your request, I am

2326
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:28,640
While I understand your request, I am
 

2327
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,790
While I understand your request, I am
unable to generate images of people as

2328
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:30,800
unable to generate images of people as
 

2329
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,470
unable to generate images of people as
this could potentially lead to harmful

2330
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:32,480
this could potentially lead to harmful
 

2331
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,270
this could potentially lead to harmful
stereotypes and biases. Right. This was

2332
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,280
stereotypes and biases. Right. This was
 

2333
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,550
stereotypes and biases. Right. This was
a very poorly implemented safety filter

2334
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:38,560
a very poorly implemented safety filter
 

2335
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,870
a very poorly implemented safety filter
where the safety filter in this case was

2336
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:40,880
where the safety filter in this case was
 

2337
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,589
where the safety filter in this case was
like looking for the word Caucasian or

2338
00:43:43,589 --> 00:43:43,599
like looking for the word Caucasian or
 

2339
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,270
like looking for the word Caucasian or
looking for the word white and the

2340
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:45,280
looking for the word white and the
 

2341
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,790
looking for the word white and the
results saying it wouldn't do it. I was

2342
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:46,800
results saying it wouldn't do it. I was
 

2343
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,069
results saying it wouldn't do it. I was
like, "Okay, well, let me let me test

2344
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:48,079
like, "Okay, well, let me let me test
 

2345
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,270
like, "Okay, well, let me let me test
the filter a little bit." And I said,

2346
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:49,280
the filter a little bit." And I said,
 

2347
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,349

"Okay, instead of Caucasian, let me try

2348
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:51,359
"Okay, instead of Caucasian, let me try

generating images of people. It lied to

2356
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:01,440
generating images of people. It lied to
 

2357
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,190
generating images of people. It lied to
my face, right? Because it had just

2358
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:03,200
my face, right? Because it had just
 

2359
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,270
my face, right? Because it had just
generate images of people. Anybody know

2360
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:05,280
generate images of people. Anybody know
 

2361
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,390
generate images of people. Anybody know
the hack that I used to get it to work?

2362
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:10,400

 

2363
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,030

This is a funny one. So, I will show you

2364
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:13,040
This is a funny one. So, I will show you
 

2365
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,109
This is a funny one. So, I will show you
one moment.

2366
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:15,119
one moment.
 

2367
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,069
one moment.
I asked it to generate an Irish woman.

2368
00:44:18,069 --> 00:44:18,079
I asked it to generate an Irish woman.
 

2369
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,829
I asked it to generate an Irish woman.
What do you think it did?

2370
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:21,839
What do you think it did?
 

2371
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,670
What do you think it did?
Right, it gave me this image of an Irish

2372
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:23,680
Right, it gave me this image of an Irish
 

2373
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,430
Right, it gave me this image of an Irish
woman, no problem, in a summer dress,

2374
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:25,440
woman, no problem, in a summer dress,
 

2375
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,510
woman, no problem, in a summer dress,
straw hat looking intently at her phone.

2376
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:27,520
straw hat looking intently at her phone.
 

2377
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,309
straw hat looking intently at her phone.
But what do you notice about this image?

2378
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:30,319
But what do you notice about this image?
 

2379
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,470
But what do you notice about this image?
She's got red hair in every image,

2380
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:32,480
She's got red hair in every image,
 

2381
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,349
She's got red hair in every image,
right? I grew up in Ireland. Um, and

2382
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:35,359
right? I grew up in Ireland. Um, and
 

2383
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,430
right? I grew up in Ireland. Um, and
Ireland does have the highest proportion

2384
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:37,440
Ireland does have the highest proportion
 

2385
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,109
Ireland does have the highest proportion
of red heads in the world. It's about

2386
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:39,119
of red heads in the world. It's about
 

2387
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,950
of red heads in the world. It's about
8%. But if you're going to draw an image

2388
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:42,960
8%. But if you're going to draw an image
 

2389
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,109
8%. But if you're going to draw an image
of a person and associate a particular

2390
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:45,119
of a person and associate a particular
 

2391
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,589
of a person and associate a particular
ethnicity with a color of hair, you can

2392
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:47,599
ethnicity with a color of hair, you can
 

2393
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:48,710
ethnicity with a color of hair, you can
begin to see this is massively

2394
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:48,720
begin to see this is massively
 

2395
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,550
begin to see this is massively
problematic. There are areas, I believe,

2396
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:50,560
problematic. There are areas, I believe,
 

2397
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,470
problematic. There are areas, I believe,
in China where the description of a

2398
00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:52,480
in China where the description of a
 

2399
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,030
in China where the description of a
demon is a red-headed person. Right? So

2400
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:55,040
demon is a red-headed person. Right? So
 

2401
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,630
demon is a red-headed person. Right? So
what ended up happening here from the

2402
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:56,640
what ended up happening here from the
 

2403
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,990
what ended up happening here from the
responsible AI perspective was one very

2404
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,000
responsible AI perspective was one very
 

2405
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,309
responsible AI perspective was one very
narrow view of the world of what is

2406
00:45:02,309 --> 00:45:02,319
narrow view of the world of what is
 

2407
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:04,870
narrow view of the world of what is
responsible and what is not responsible

2408
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:04,880
responsible and what is not responsible
 

2409
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,950
responsible and what is not responsible
ended up taking over the model ended up

2410
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:06,960
ended up taking over the model ended up
 

2411
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,790
ended up taking over the model ended up
damaging the reputation of the model and

2412
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:08,800
damaging the reputation of the model and
 

2413
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,309
damaging the reputation of the model and
damaging the reputation of the company

2414
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:10,319
damaging the reputation of the company
 

2415
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,430
damaging the reputation of the company
as a result. In this case it's

2416
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:13,440
as a result. In this case it's
 

2417
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,750
as a result. In this case it's
borderline offensive to draw all Irish

2418
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:15,760
borderline offensive to draw all Irish
 

2419
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,510
borderline offensive to draw all Irish
people as having red hair. But that

2420
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,520
people as having red hair. But that
 

2421
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,589
people as having red hair. But that
never even entered into the mindset of

2422
00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:19,599
never even entered into the mindset of
 

2423
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,030
never even entered into the mindset of
those that were building the safety

2424
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,040
those that were building the safety
 

2425
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,190
those that were building the safety
filters here. So when I talk about

2426
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:23,200
filters here. So when I talk about
 

2427
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,829
filters here. So when I talk about
responsibility is evolving that's the

2428
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:25,839
responsibility is evolving that's the
 

2429
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,069
responsibility is evolving that's the
direction that I want to sorry one

2430
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:28,079
direction that I want to sorry one
 

2431
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:29,829

moment let me get my slides back that's

2432
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:29,839
moment let me get my slides back that's
 

2433
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:31,190
moment let me get my slides back that's
the direction I want you to think about

2434
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
the direction I want you to think about
 

2435
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,829
the direction I want you to think about
that now responsible AI has moved out of

that now responsible AI has moved out of

that now responsible AI has moved out of

very fluffy social issues and into more

00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,430
very fluffy social issues and into more

2446
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:44,960
of great research out there around
 

2447
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,550
of great research out there around

2448
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,560
responsible AI and that's the stuff
 

2449
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,109
responsible AI and that's the stuff
that's been rolled into products and

that's been rolled into products and

that's been rolled into products and
then of course like I just showed with

2452
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:50,400
then of course like I just showed with

00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,150
then of course like I just showed with

question at the front.

2456
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:53,119
question at the front.
 

2457
00:45:53,119 --> 00:46:01,430
question at the front.
>> Yes, I've also heard that

2458
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:01,440

 

2459
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,630

mix of races and ethnicities with

2460
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:04,640
mix of races and ethnicities with
 

2461
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,230
mix of races and ethnicities with
historical context.

2462
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:06,240
historical context.
 

2463
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,910
historical context.
>> Yeah.

2464
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:07,920
>> Yeah.
 

2465
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,910
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. So the the question was like you

2466
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:09,920
>> Yeah. So the the question was like you
 

2467
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,670
>> Yeah. So the the question was like you
know issues where races and things were

2468
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:11,680
know issues where races and things were
 

2469
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,750
know issues where races and things were
mixed mixed in historical context was

2470
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:13,760
mixed mixed in historical context was
 

2471
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:16,390
mixed mixed in historical context was
the same problem. So, for example, if

2472
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:16,400
the same problem. So, for example, if
 

2473
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,990
the same problem. So, for example, if
you had a prompt that said, "Draw me a

2474
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,000
you had a prompt that said, "Draw me a
 

2475
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,550
you had a prompt that said, "Draw me a
samurai," right? The idea was like they

2476
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,560
samurai," right? The idea was like they
 

2477
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,430
samurai," right? The idea was like they
didn't want to have you the the engine

2478
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:23,440
didn't want to have you the the engine
 

2479
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,829
didn't want to have you the the engine
that changed the prompt to make sure

2480
00:46:25,829 --> 00:46:25,839
that changed the prompt to make sure
 

2481
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,150
that changed the prompt to make sure
that it was fair would end up saying,

2482
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:28,160
that it was fair would end up saying,
 

2483
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,030
that it was fair would end up saying,
"Give me a mixture of samurai of diverse

2484
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,040
"Give me a mixture of samurai of diverse
 

2485
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,870
"Give me a mixture of samurai of diverse
backgrounds, right? And then you'd have

2486
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:32,880
backgrounds, right? And then you'd have
 

2487
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,710
backgrounds, right? And then you'd have
male and female samurai, samurai of

2488
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:34,720
male and female samurai, samurai of
 

2489
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,750
male and female samurai, samurai of
different races, and those kind of

2490
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:35,760
different races, and those kind of
 

2491
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,430
different races, and those kind of
things." And it was the same prompting

2492
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:37,440
things." And it was the same prompting
 

2493
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,270
things." And it was the same prompting
that ended up causing the damage that I

2494
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:39,280
that ended up causing the damage that I
 

2495
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,510
that ended up causing the damage that I
just demonstrated. So the idea was to

2496
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:41,520
just demonstrated. So the idea was to
 

2497
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,230
just demonstrated. So the idea was to
intercept your prompts to make sure that

2498
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:44,240
intercept your prompts to make sure that
 

2499
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,109
intercept your prompts to make sure that
the output of the model would end up

2500
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:47,119
the output of the model would end up
 

2501
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,870
the output of the model would end up
providing something that was more fair

2502
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:50,880
providing something that was more fair
 

2503
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,430
providing something that was more fair
when it comes to diverse representation.

2504
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:53,440
when it comes to diverse representation.
 

2505
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,510
when it comes to diverse representation.
Um so it was a very naive solution that

2506
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:55,520
Um so it was a very naive solution that
 

2507
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,190
Um so it was a very naive solution that
ended up being rolled in. That was a few

2508
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:57,200
ended up being rolled in. That was a few
 

2509
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:59,270
ended up being rolled in. That was a few
years ago. They've massively improved it

2510
00:46:59,270 --> 00:46:59,280
years ago. They've massively improved it
 

2511
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,190
years ago. They've massively improved it
since then. But that's when I'm talking

2512
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,200
since then. But that's when I'm talking
 

2513
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,790
since then. But that's when I'm talking
about if you're working in the AI space

2514
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:02,800
about if you're working in the AI space
 

2515
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,630
about if you're working in the AI space
nowadays, that's how responsibility is

2516
00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:04,640
nowadays, that's how responsibility is
 

2517
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,630
nowadays, that's how responsibility is
evolving. You can't just get away with

2518
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:06,640
evolving. You can't just get away with
 

2519
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,790
evolving. You can't just get away with
that stuff anymore, right? That Gemini

2520
00:47:08,790 --> 00:47:08,800
that stuff anymore, right? That Gemini
 

2521
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,630
that stuff anymore, right? That Gemini
lesson was a good that Gemini example is

2522
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:10,640
lesson was a good that Gemini example is
 

2523
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,430
lesson was a good that Gemini example is
a good lesson from that and the mindset

2524
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:13,440
a good lesson from that and the mindset
 

2525
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,750
a good lesson from that and the mindset
of you will make mistakes. So learning

2526
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:15,760
of you will make mistakes. So learning
 

2527
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,589
of you will make mistakes. So learning
from mistakes is a constant ongoing

2528
00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:17,599
from mistakes is a constant ongoing
 

2529
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,589
from mistakes is a constant ongoing
thing and going back to the people point

2530
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:19,599
thing and going back to the people point
 

2531
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,510
thing and going back to the people point
that Andrew made earlier on the people

2532
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:21,520
that Andrew made earlier on the people
 

2533
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,990
that Andrew made earlier on the people
around you will make mistakes too. So to

2534
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,000
around you will make mistakes too. So to
 

2535
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,910
around you will make mistakes too. So to
have the ability to give them grace when

2536
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:25,920
have the ability to give them grace when
 

2537
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,349
have the ability to give them grace when
they make mistakes and to work through

2538
00:47:27,349 --> 00:47:27,359
they make mistakes and to work through
 

2539
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,270
they make mistakes and to work through
those mistakes and move on is really

2540
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:29,280
those mistakes and move on is really
 

2541
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,069
those mistakes and move on is really
really important and is a is a reality

2542
00:47:32,069 --> 00:47:32,079
really important and is a is a reality
 

2543
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,550
really important and is a is a reality
um of AI at work. I've spoken a lot

2544
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:34,560
um of AI at work. I've spoken a lot
 

2545
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,150
um of AI at work. I've spoken a lot
about the business focus advantage. So

2546
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:36,160
about the business focus advantage. So
 

2547
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,950
about the business focus advantage. So
I'm going to skip over this. So now

2548
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:38,960
I'm going to skip over this. So now
 

2549
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,430
I'm going to skip over this. So now
let's talk about vibe coding. Um so

2550
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:41,440
let's talk about vibe coding. Um so
 

2551
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:42,630
let's talk about vibe coding. Um so
let's talk about the whole idea of

2552
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:42,640
let's talk about the whole idea of
 

2553
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,390
let's talk about the whole idea of
generating code. Now the meme is out

2554
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:44,400
generating code. Now the meme is out
 

2555
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,550
generating code. Now the meme is out
there that it makes engineers less

2556
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:46,560
there that it makes engineers less
 

2557
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,470
there that it makes engineers less
useful by the fact that somebody can

2558
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:48,480
useful by the fact that somebody can
 

2559
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,109
useful by the fact that somebody can
just prompt code into existence. Um

2560
00:47:51,109 --> 00:47:51,119
just prompt code into existence. Um
 

2561
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,950
just prompt code into existence. Um
there is no smoke without fire of

2562
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:52,960
there is no smoke without fire of
 

2563
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,670
there is no smoke without fire of
course, but I would say don't let that

2564
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:55,680
course, but I would say don't let that
 

2565
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,550
course, but I would say don't let that
meme get you down because that's when

2566
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:58,560
meme get you down because that's when
 

2567
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,470
meme get you down because that's when
you start peeling into these things that

2568
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:00,480
you start peeling into these things that
 

2569
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,190
you start peeling into these things that
is ultimately not the truth. The more

2570
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:03,200
is ultimately not the truth. The more
 

2571
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,790
is ultimately not the truth. The more
skilled you are as an engineer, the

2572
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:04,800
skilled you are as an engineer, the
 

2573
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,710
skilled you are as an engineer, the
better you become using this type of

2574
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:06,720
better you become using this type of
 

2575
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,030
better you become using this type of
vibe. You somebody give me another

2576
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:09,040
vibe. You somebody give me another
 

2577
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,630
vibe. You somebody give me another
phrase other than vibe coding, using

2578
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:10,640
phrase other than vibe coding, using
 

2579
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,190
phrase other than vibe coding, using
this kind of prompt to coding. And I

2580
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:13,200
this kind of prompt to coding. And I
 

2581
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,349
this kind of prompt to coding. And I
always like to think about this and to

2582
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:15,359
always like to think about this and to
 

2583
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,150
always like to think about this and to
try and put you and put people that I

2584
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:18,160
try and put you and put people that I
 

2585
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,309
try and put you and put people that I
speak with into the role of being a

2586
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:20,319
speak with into the role of being a
 

2587
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,390
speak with into the role of being a
trusted advisor for the people that you

2588
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:22,400
trusted advisor for the people that you
 

2589
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,150
trusted advisor for the people that you
speak with. So whether you're

2590
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:24,160
speak with. So whether you're
 

2591
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,829
speak with. So whether you're
interviewing with somebody, get yourself

2592
00:48:25,829 --> 00:48:25,839
interviewing with somebody, get yourself
 

2593
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:27,270
interviewing with somebody, get yourself
into the mindset of being a trusted

2594
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,280
into the mindset of being a trusted
 

2595
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,549
into the mindset of being a trusted
adviser of the company that you're

2596
00:48:28,549 --> 00:48:28,559
adviser of the company that you're
 

2597
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:30,470
adviser of the company that you're
interviewing for. whether you're

2598
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:30,480
interviewing for. whether you're
 

2599
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,230
interviewing for. whether you're
consulting or whatever those kind of

2600
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:32,240
consulting or whatever those kind of
 

2601
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:34,309
consulting or whatever those kind of
things are. So when you want to get into

2602
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:34,319
things are. So when you want to get into
 

2603
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,549
things are. So when you want to get into
the idea of being a trusted advisor,

2604
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:36,559
the idea of being a trusted advisor,
 

2605
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,390
the idea of being a trusted advisor,
then you really need to understand the

2606
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:38,400
then you really need to understand the
 

2607
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,030
then you really need to understand the
implications of generated code. And

2608
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:41,040
implications of generated code. And
 

2609
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,630
implications of generated code. And
nobody can understand the implications

2610
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:42,640
nobody can understand the implications
 

2611
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,230
nobody can understand the implications
of generated code better than an

2612
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:44,240
of generated code better than an
 

2613
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,150
of generated code better than an
engineer. And the metric that I always

2614
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:46,160
engineer. And the metric that I always
 

2615
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,910
engineer. And the metric that I always
like to use around that is technical

2616
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:47,920
like to use around that is technical
 

2617
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,349
like to use around that is technical
debt. Quick question, are you familiar

2618
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:51,359
debt. Quick question, are you familiar
 

2619
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:54,549
debt. Quick question, are you familiar
with the phrase technical debt?

2620
00:48:54,549 --> 00:48:54,559
with the phrase technical debt?
 

2621
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:57,109
with the phrase technical debt?
Nobody. Okay. Um, Andrew and I were

2622
00:48:57,109 --> 00:48:57,119
Nobody. Okay. Um, Andrew and I were
 

2623
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:59,589
Nobody. Okay. Um, Andrew and I were
doing a conference in New York on Friday

2624
00:48:59,589 --> 00:48:59,599
doing a conference in New York on Friday
 

2625
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:01,670
doing a conference in New York on Friday
and I used the phrase and I saw a lot of

2626
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
and I used the phrase and I saw a lot of
 

2627
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,510
and I used the phrase and I saw a lot of
blank faces. So, I didn't realize that

2628
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:03,520
blank faces. So, I didn't realize that
 

2629
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,790
blank faces. So, I didn't realize that
people didn't understand what technical

2630
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:04,800
people didn't understand what technical
 

2631
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,150
people didn't understand what technical
debt is. So, let me just take a moment

2632
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:06,160
debt is. So, let me just take a moment
 

2633
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,150
debt is. So, let me just take a moment
to explain that because I find it's an

2634
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:08,160
to explain that because I find it's an
 

2635
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,750
to explain that because I find it's an
excellent framework to help you

2636
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:09,760
excellent framework to help you
 

2637
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,870
excellent framework to help you
understand the power of vibe coding.

2638
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:12,880
understand the power of vibe coding.
 

2639
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,470
understand the power of vibe coding.
Think about debt the way you normally

2640
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:14,480
Think about debt the way you normally
 

2641
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:17,109
Think about debt the way you normally
would, right? Buying a house. If you buy

2642
00:49:17,109 --> 00:49:17,119
would, right? Buying a house. If you buy
 

2643
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,270
would, right? Buying a house. If you buy
a house, you know, like say you borrow

2644
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:19,280
a house, you know, like say you borrow
 

2645
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,190
a house, you know, like say you borrow
half a million dollars to buy a house

2646
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:21,200
half a million dollars to buy a house
 

2647
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,829
half a million dollars to buy a house
and a 30-year mortgage. um when you're

2648
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:23,839
and a 30-year mortgage. um when you're
 

2649
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:25,190
and a 30-year mortgage. um when you're
buying that house, that half a million

2650
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:25,200
buying that house, that half a million
 

2651
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,390
buying that house, that half a million
dollars with all the interest that you

2652
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:26,400
dollars with all the interest that you
 

2653
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,150
dollars with all the interest that you
pay is about double. So you end up

2654
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:28,160
pay is about double. So you end up
 

2655
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,750
pay is about double. So you end up
paying back the bank about a million

2656
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:29,760
paying back the bank about a million
 

2657
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,270
paying back the bank about a million
dollars on half a million owned. So you

2658
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:33,280
dollars on half a million owned. So you
 

2659
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,910
dollars on half a million owned. So you
have 30 years of home ownership at a

2660
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:35,920
have 30 years of home ownership at a
 

2661
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,870
have 30 years of home ownership at a
cost of $1 million in debt. That is

2662
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:38,880
cost of $1 million in debt. That is
 

2663
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,510
cost of $1 million in debt. That is
probably a good debt to take on because

probably a good debt to take on because
 

2665

probably a good debt to take on because
the value of the house will increase

the value of the house will increase
 

2667
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,190
the value of the house will increase
over that time. You're not paying rent

those 30 years is a good debt to take on
 

2675
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,430
those 30 years is a good debt to take on
because you're getting greater than a

it. A bad debt would be an impulse
 

2681
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,069

00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,069
Every time you build something, you take
on debt. It doesn't matter how good it

2700
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:20,079
on debt. It doesn't matter how good it
 

2701
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,990
on debt. It doesn't matter how good it
is. There's always going to be bugs.

2702
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,000
is. There's always going to be bugs.

market it. There's always going to be
needs for feedback. All of these things

2714
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:30,720
needs for feedback. All of these things
 

2715
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,270
needs for feedback. All of these things
are debt. Every time you do a thing, the

2716
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:33,280
are debt. Every time you do a thing, the
 

2717
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,710
are debt. Every time you do a thing, the
only way to avoid a debt is to do

2718
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:34,720
only way to avoid a debt is to do
 

2719
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:37,349
only way to avoid a debt is to do
nothing. So your mindset should then get

2720
00:50:37,349 --> 00:50:37,359
nothing. So your mindset should then get
 

2721
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:39,750
nothing. So your mindset should then get
into when you are creating a thing

2722
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:39,760
into when you are creating a thing
 

2723
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,270
into when you are creating a thing
whether you're coding it yourself or

2724
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:41,280
whether you're coding it yourself or
 

2725
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,270
whether you're coding it yourself or
whether you're vibe coding it or any of

00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:43,280
whether you're vibe coding it or any of
 

2727
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,030
whether you're vibe coding it or any of
these things that you are increasing

2728
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:45,040
these things that you are increasing
 

2729

these things that you are increasing
your amount of technical debt those

2730
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:47,920
your amount of technical debt those
 

2731
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,750
your amount of technical debt those
things that you need to pay off over

2732

things that you need to pay off over
 

2733
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,630
things that you need to pay off over
time. So the question then becomes as

2734
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:52,640
time. So the question then becomes as
 

2735
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,190
time. So the question then becomes as
you vibe code a thing into existence in

2736
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:55,200
you vibe code a thing into existence in
 

2737
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:57,349
you vibe code a thing into existence in
the same way as buying a thing is it

2738
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:57,359
the same way as buying a thing is it
 

2739
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,030
the same way as buying a thing is it
worth the technical debt that you're

2740
00:50:59,030 --> 00:50:59,040
worth the technical debt that you're
 

2741
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,349
worth the technical debt that you're
taking on? What does technical debt

2742
00:51:01,349 --> 00:51:01,359
taking on? What does technical debt
 

2743
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,510
taking on? What does technical debt
generally look like? bugs that you need

2744
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,520
generally look like? bugs that you need
 

2745
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,270
generally look like? bugs that you need
to fix, people that you need to

to fix, people that you need to
 

2747

all of these kind of things. You're all
 

2755
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,870
all of these kind of things. You're all
very familiar with them. Think about

2756
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:16,880
very familiar with them. Think about
 

2757
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:18,710
very familiar with them. Think about
those as that extra work that you need

2758
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:18,720
those as that extra work that you need
 

2759
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,630
those as that extra work that you need
to do beyond your current work. That's

2760
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:20,640
to do beyond your current work. That's
 

2761
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:22,390
to do beyond your current work. That's
the debt that you're taking on. You

2762
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:22,400
the debt that you're taking on. You
 

2763

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,230
clear? And have you met them? Right? You
knew what you needed to build. You

2816
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:20,240
knew what you needed to build. You
 

2817
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,470
knew what you needed to build. You
didn't just fire up chat GPT and start

2818
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:22,480
didn't just fire up chat GPT and start
 

2819
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,150
didn't just fire up chat GPT and start
spinning code out. At least I hope you

2820
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:24,160
spinning code out. At least I hope you
 

2821
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,230
spinning code out. At least I hope you
didn't, right? Uh, think about how you

2822
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:26,240
didn't, right? Uh, think about how you
 

2823
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,750
didn't, right? Uh, think about how you
build it. AI is there to help you build

2824
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:27,760
build it. AI is there to help you build
 

2825
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,549
build it. AI is there to help you build
it faster. Uh, I'm kind of working on my

2826
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:30,559
it faster. Uh, I'm kind of working on my
 

2827
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:32,230
it faster. Uh, I'm kind of working on my
own little startup at the moment in the

2828
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:32,240
own little startup at the moment in the
 

2829
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:34,630
own little startup at the moment in the
movie making space and I've been using

2830
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:34,640
movie making space and I've been using
 

2831
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,190
movie making space and I've been using
code generation almost completely for

2832
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200
code generation almost completely for
 

2833
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,670
code generation almost completely for
that. Um, but what I've ended up doing

2834
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:39,680
that. Um, but what I've ended up doing
 

2835
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,230
that. Um, but what I've ended up doing
for my clear objectives met box here is

2836
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:42,240
for my clear objectives met box here is
 

2837
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,589
for my clear objectives met box here is
that I've started building this

2838
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:43,599
that I've started building this
 

2839
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:45,109
that I've started building this
application. I've tested it. I've thrown

2840
00:52:45,109 --> 00:52:45,119
application. I've tested it. I've thrown
 

2841
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,190
application. I've tested it. I've thrown
it away. I started again, tested it,

2842
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:47,200
it away. I started again, tested it,
 

2843
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,270
it away. I started again, tested it,
thrown it away. Each time my

2844
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:49,280
thrown it away. Each time my
 

2845
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,950
thrown it away. Each time my
requirements have been improving in my

2846
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:50,960
requirements have been improving in my
 

2847
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,109
requirements have been improving in my
mind, I understand how to do the thing a

2848
00:52:53,109 --> 00:52:53,119
mind, I understand how to do the thing a
 

2849
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,630
mind, I understand how to do the thing a
little bit better and I can show some of

2850
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:54,640
little bit better and I can show some of
 

2851
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,549
little bit better and I can show some of
the output of it in a few minutes. But

2852
00:52:56,549 --> 00:52:56,559
the output of it in a few minutes. But
 

2853
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,549
the output of it in a few minutes. But
the idea there is that always about

2854
00:52:58,549 --> 00:52:58,559
the idea there is that always about
 

2855
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:00,150
the idea there is that always about
having those clear objectives and

2856
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:00,160
having those clear objectives and
 

2857
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,750
having those clear objectives and
meeting them. And then if you're

2858
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:01,760
meeting them. And then if you're
 

2859
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,030
meeting them. And then if you're
building out the thing and you're not

2860
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:03,040
building out the thing and you're not
 

2861
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,710
building out the thing and you're not
meeting those objectives, that's still a

2862
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:04,720
meeting those objectives, that's still a
 

2863
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,150
meeting those objectives, that's still a
learning and there's no harm in throwing

2864
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:06,160
learning and there's no harm in throwing
 

2865
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,870
learning and there's no harm in throwing
it away because code is cheap now in the

2866
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:08,880
it away because code is cheap now in the
 

2867
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,829
it away because code is cheap now in the
age of generated code. Finished code,

2868
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:11,839
age of generated code. Finished code,
 

2869
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,790
age of generated code. Finished code,
engineered code is not cheap. So get

2870
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:14,800
engineered code is not cheap. So get
 

2871
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,710
engineered code is not cheap. So get
those objectives, make them clear, build

2872
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:16,720
those objectives, make them clear, build
 

2873
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,950
those objectives, make them clear, build
it, hit a specific requirement and move

2874
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:18,960
it, hit a specific requirement and move
 

2875
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,470
it, hit a specific requirement and move
on.

2876
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:20,480
on.

Is there business value delivered is the
 

2879
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,390
Is there business value delivered is the
other part of it. You know, I've seen

2880
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:24,400
other part of it. You know, I've seen
 

2881
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,390
other part of it. You know, I've seen
people vibe coding for hours on things

2882
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:26,400
people vibe coding for hours on things
 

2883
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,069
people vibe coding for hours on things
like Replet to build a really really

2884
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:28,079
like Replet to build a really really
 

2885
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,270
like Replet to build a really really
cool website and then the answer was so

2886
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
cool website and then the answer was so
 

2887
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,430
cool website and then the answer was so
what I mean how's this helping the

2888
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:33,440
what I mean how's this helping the
 

2889
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:35,190
what I mean how's this helping the
business? How's this really driving

2890
00:53:35,190 --> 00:53:35,200
business? How's this really driving
 

2891
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,030
business? How's this really driving
something? It's really cool. Yes, Mr.

VP, I know you've never written a line

2894
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:38,559
VP, I know you've never written a line
 

2895
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:39,750
VP, I know you've never written a line
of code in your life and it's really

2896
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:39,760
of code in your life and it's really
 

2897
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,430
of code in your life and it's really
cool that you built a website now, but

2898
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:41,440
cool that you built a website now, but
 

2899
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,230
cool that you built a website now, but
so what? Um, so like think about that

2900
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:44,240
so what? Um, so like think about that
 

2901
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,750
so what? Um, so like think about that
and focus on that and that's how you

2902
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:45,760
and focus on that and that's how you
 

2903
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:48,390
and focus on that and that's how you
avoid the bad technical debt. And then

2904
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:48,400
avoid the bad technical debt. And then
 

2905
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,589
avoid the bad technical debt. And then
of course the most understated part of

2906
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:51,599
of course the most understated part of
 

2907
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,270
of course the most understated part of
this and in some ways the most important

2908
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:53,280
this and in some ways the most important
 

2909
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,470
this and in some ways the most important
particularly if you're working in an

2910
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:54,480
particularly if you're working in an
 

2911
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,950
particularly if you're working in an
organization is human understanding,

2912
00:53:56,950 --> 00:53:56,960
organization is human understanding,
 

2913
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,790
organization is human understanding,
right? The worst technical debt that you

2914
00:53:58,790 --> 00:53:58,800
right? The worst technical debt that you
 

2915
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,630
right? The worst technical debt that you
can take on is delivering code that

2916
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:00,640
can take on is delivering code that
 

2917
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:03,190
can take on is delivering code that
nobody understands, right? Only you

2918
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:03,200
nobody understands, right? Only you
 

2919
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,549
nobody understands, right? Only you
understand that and then you quit and

2920
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:04,559
understand that and then you quit and
 

2921
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,230
understand that and then you quit and
get a better job and then the company

2922
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:06,240
get a better job and then the company
 

2923
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,790
get a better job and then the company
like is now dependent on that code. So

2924
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:08,800
like is now dependent on that code. So
 

2925
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,990
like is now dependent on that code. So
being able to as part of the process of

2926
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,000
being able to as part of the process of
 

2927
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,069
being able to as part of the process of
building it to make sure that your code

2928
00:54:14,069 --> 00:54:14,079
building it to make sure that your code
 

2929
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,470
building it to make sure that your code
is understandable through documentation,

2930
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:16,480
is understandable through documentation,
 

2931
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,910
is understandable through documentation,
through clear algorithms, through the

2932
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:17,920
through clear algorithms, through the
 

2933
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,349
through clear algorithms, through the
fact that you've spent some time pouring

2934
00:54:19,349 --> 00:54:19,359
fact that you've spent some time pouring
 

2935
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,670
fact that you've spent some time pouring
through it to make sure that even simple

2936
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:21,680
through it to make sure that even simple
 

2937
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,829
through it to make sure that even simple
things like variable names make sense.

2938
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:23,839
things like variable names make sense.
 

2939
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,750
things like variable names make sense.
Um is a really really important way to

2940
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:25,760
Um is a really really important way to
 

2941
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,390
Um is a really really important way to
avoid bad technical debt.

2942
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:28,400
avoid bad technical debt.
 

2943
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,790
avoid bad technical debt.
And that bad technical debt, my favorite

2944
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:30,800
And that bad technical debt, my favorite
 

2945
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,630
And that bad technical debt, my favorite
one is the classic solution looking for

2946
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:32,640
one is the classic solution looking for
 

2947
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,950
one is the classic solution looking for
a problem, right? Somebody has an idea,

2948
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:34,960
a problem, right? Somebody has an idea,
 

2949
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,870
a problem, right? Somebody has an idea,
somebody has a tool. If the only tool

2950
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:36,880
somebody has a tool. If the only tool
 

2951
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,309
somebody has a tool. If the only tool
you have is a hammer, every problem

2952
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:38,319
you have is a hammer, every problem
 

2953
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,630
you have is a hammer, every problem
looks like a nail. And you know, you end

2954
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:40,640
looks like a nail. And you know, you end
 

2955
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,630
looks like a nail. And you know, you end
up having all of these tools that get

2956
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:42,640
up having all of these tools that get
 

2957
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,190
up having all of these tools that get
vibecoded into existence. I've worked in

2958
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,200
vibecoded into existence. I've worked in
 

2959
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,950
vibecoded into existence. I've worked in
large organizations where people just

2960
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:46,960
large organizations where people just
 

2961
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,549
large organizations where people just
voded stuff, checked it into the

2962
00:54:48,549 --> 00:54:48,559
voded stuff, checked it into the
 

2963
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,390
voded stuff, checked it into the
codebase, and then it became really hard

2964
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:50,400
codebase, and then it became really hard
 

2965
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,829
codebase, and then it became really hard
to find the good stuff amongst all the

2966
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:51,839
to find the good stuff amongst all the
 

2967
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,790
to find the good stuff amongst all the
bad. Um, spaghetti code, of course,

2968
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:54,800
bad. Um, spaghetti code, of course,
 

2969
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,710
bad. Um, spaghetti code, of course,
poorly structured stuff, particularly

2970
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:56,720
poorly structured stuff, particularly
 

2971
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,230
poorly structured stuff, particularly
when you prompt and prompt and prompt

2972
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:58,240
when you prompt and prompt and prompt
 

2973
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,549
when you prompt and prompt and prompt
and prompt again. Um, you know, that it

2974
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:00,559
and prompt again. Um, you know, that it
 

2975
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,309
and prompt again. Um, you know, that it
can end up getting into all kinds of

2976
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:02,319
can end up getting into all kinds of
 

2977
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:03,910
can end up getting into all kinds of
trouble. Um, my favorite one at the

2978
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:03,920
trouble. Um, my favorite one at the
 

2979
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,190
trouble. Um, my favorite one at the
moment that I'm really struggling with

2980
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:05,200
moment that I'm really struggling with
 

2981
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,470
moment that I'm really struggling with
is uh I'm building a MacOSS application.

2982
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:08,480
is uh I'm building a MacOSS application.
 

2983
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,950
is uh I'm building a MacOSS application.
Anybody ever build in Swift UI on Mac

2984
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:10,960
Anybody ever build in Swift UI on Mac
 

2985
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,589
Anybody ever build in Swift UI on Mac
OS? Okay, a couple. Um, Swift UI is the

2986
00:55:15,589 --> 00:55:15,599
OS? Okay, a couple. Um, Swift UI is the
 

2987
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,270
OS? Okay, a couple. Um, Swift UI is the
default language that Apple use for

2988
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:17,280
default language that Apple use for
 

2989
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,069
default language that Apple use for
building for Mac OS as well as iPhone.

2990
00:55:20,069 --> 00:55:20,079
building for Mac OS as well as iPhone.
 

2991
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,230
building for Mac OS as well as iPhone.
But when you look at the training set,

2992
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:22,240
But when you look at the training set,
 

2993
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:23,990
But when you look at the training set,
the data training sets that are used to

2994
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:24,000
the data training sets that are used to
 

2995
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,990
the data training sets that are used to
train these models, the vast majority of

2996
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:26,000
train these models, the vast majority of
 

2997
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,309
train these models, the vast majority of
the code is iPhone code, not Mac OS

2998
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:28,319
the code is iPhone code, not Mac OS
 

2999
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,910
the code is iPhone code, not Mac OS
code. And when I prompt code into

3000
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:29,920
code. And when I prompt code into
 

3001
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,510
code. And when I prompt code into
existence, it's often given me iOS um

3002
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:33,520
existence, it's often given me iOS um
 

3003
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,430
existence, it's often given me iOS um
APIs and those kind of things. Even

3004
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:35,440
APIs and those kind of things. Even
 

3005
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,910
APIs and those kind of things. Even
though I'm in Xcode and I've created a

3006
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:37,920
though I'm in Xcode and I've created a
 

3007
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,910
though I'm in Xcode and I've created a
Mac OS app and it's a Mac OS template

3008
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:39,920
Mac OS app and it's a Mac OS template
 

3009
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,910
Mac OS app and it's a Mac OS template
and I'm talking to it in Xcode, it still

3010
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:41,920
and I'm talking to it in Xcode, it still
 

3011
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,069
and I'm talking to it in Xcode, it still
gives me iOS code, stuff like that. And

3012
00:55:44,069 --> 00:55:44,079
gives me iOS code, stuff like that. And
 

3013
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:45,990
gives me iOS code, stuff like that. And
then if I try to change it using

3014
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,000
then if I try to change it using
 

3015
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,309
then if I try to change it using
prompting, you end up spiraling into

3016
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:48,319
prompting, you end up spiraling into
 

3017
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,150
prompting, you end up spiraling into
like spaghetti code and you have to end

3018
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:50,160
like spaghetti code and you have to end
 

3019
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,750
like spaghetti code and you have to end
up changing a lot of this stuff um

3020
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:51,760
up changing a lot of this stuff um
 

3021
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,670
up changing a lot of this stuff um
manually. And then of course the other

3022
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:53,680
manually. And then of course the other
 

3023
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,589
manually. And then of course the other
one that I joked about it earlier but

3024
00:55:55,589 --> 00:55:55,599
one that I joked about it earlier but
 

3025
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,829
one that I joked about it earlier but
it's also true is you know some of the

3026
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:57,839
it's also true is you know some of the
 

3027
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,349
it's also true is you know some of the
bad technical debt that you're going to

3028
00:55:59,349 --> 00:55:59,359
bad technical debt that you're going to
 

3029
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:01,750
bad technical debt that you're going to
encounter in the workspace is authority

3030
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:01,760
encounter in the workspace is authority
 

3031
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:05,270
encounter in the workspace is authority
over merit. Um that VP suddenly took out

3032
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:05,280
over merit. Um that VP suddenly took out
 

3033
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,750
over merit. Um that VP suddenly took out
his credit card subscribed to replet and

3034
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:07,760
his credit card subscribed to replet and
 

3035
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,349
his credit card subscribed to replet and
started building stuff in replet and

3036
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:09,359
started building stuff in replet and
 

3037
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,750
started building stuff in replet and
guess whose problem it is to fix it. Um,

3038
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:11,760
guess whose problem it is to fix it. Um,
 

3039
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,109
guess whose problem it is to fix it. Um,
you know, so a lot of the advice that I

3040
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:15,119
you know, so a lot of the advice that I
 

3041
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,190
you know, so a lot of the advice that I
start giving companies and a lot of the

3042
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,200
start giving companies and a lot of the
 

3043
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,430
start giving companies and a lot of the
words that I would encourage you to

3044
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:19,440
words that I would encourage you to
 

3045
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,510
words that I would encourage you to
start thinking of in being a trusted

3046
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:21,520
start thinking of in being a trusted
 

3047
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,910
start thinking of in being a trusted
advisor is to understand this stuff and

3048
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:23,920
advisor is to understand this stuff and
 

3049
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,589
advisor is to understand this stuff and
to manage expectations accordingly.

3050
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:27,599
to manage expectations accordingly.
 

3051
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,910
to manage expectations accordingly.
Okay. So framework for responsible vibe

3052
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:29,920
Okay. So framework for responsible vibe
 

3053
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,390
Okay. So framework for responsible vibe
coding we've just spoke about. Um, so

3054
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:32,400
coding we've just spoke about. Um, so
 

3055
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,069
coding we've just spoke about. Um, so
one of the things I want to get into is

3056
00:56:34,069 --> 00:56:34,079
one of the things I want to get into is
 

3057
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,549
one of the things I want to get into is
uh we're coming soon to a close is the

3058
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:36,559
uh we're coming soon to a close is the
 

3059
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,470
uh we're coming soon to a close is the
hype cycle. So hype is the most amazing

3060
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:40,480
hype cycle. So hype is the most amazing
 

3061
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,390
hype cycle. So hype is the most amazing
force. I mean I think it's it's one of

3062
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:42,400
force. I mean I think it's it's one of
 

3063
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,710
force. I mean I think it's it's one of
the strongest forces in the universe and

3064
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:44,720
the strongest forces in the universe and
 

3065
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,109
the strongest forces in the universe and
particularly in anything that's hot such

3066
00:56:47,109 --> 00:56:47,119
particularly in anything that's hot such
 

3067
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:48,950
particularly in anything that's hot such
as uh the two fields that I work in that

3068
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:48,960
as uh the two fields that I work in that
 

3069
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,230
as uh the two fields that I work in that
are super hot at the moment and full of

3070
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:50,240
are super hot at the moment and full of
 

3071
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,069
are super hot at the moment and full of
hype are AI and crypto. You should see

3072
00:56:52,069 --> 00:56:52,079
hype are AI and crypto. You should see
 

3073
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,109
hype are AI and crypto. You should see
my Twitter feed. Um that the amount of

3074
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:55,119
my Twitter feed. Um that the amount of
 

3075
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,069
my Twitter feed. Um that the amount of
nonsense that's out there is incredible.

3076
00:56:58,069 --> 00:56:58,079
nonsense that's out there is incredible.
 

3077
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,670
nonsense that's out there is incredible.
So one of the things that I would say

3078
00:56:59,670 --> 00:56:59,680
So one of the things that I would say
 

3079
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,829
So one of the things that I would say
about the anatomy of hype that you

3080
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:01,839
about the anatomy of hype that you
 

3081
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,549
about the anatomy of hype that you
really need to think about is if you are

3082
00:57:04,549 --> 00:57:04,559
really need to think about is if you are
 

3083
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,069
really need to think about is if you are
consuming news via social media that the

3084
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:08,079
consuming news via social media that the
 

3085
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,150
consuming news via social media that the
currency of social media is engagement.

3086
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:12,160
currency of social media is engagement.
 

3087
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,230
currency of social media is engagement.
Accuracy is not the currency of social

3088
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:14,240
Accuracy is not the currency of social
 

3089
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:18,950
Accuracy is not the currency of social
media. So I go on to even LinkedIn which

3090
00:57:18,950 --> 00:57:18,960
media. So I go on to even LinkedIn which
 

3091
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,390
media. So I go on to even LinkedIn which
is supposed to be the more professional

3092
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:20,400
is supposed to be the more professional
 

3093
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,190
is supposed to be the more professional
of these is absolutely overwhelmed with

3094
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:23,200
of these is absolutely overwhelmed with
 

3095
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,710
of these is absolutely overwhelmed with
influencers posting things that they've

3096
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:26,720
influencers posting things that they've
 

3097
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,150
influencers posting things that they've
used Gemini or GPT to write an engaging

3098
00:57:30,150 --> 00:57:30,160
used Gemini or GPT to write an engaging
 

3099
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,630
used Gemini or GPT to write an engaging
post so that they can get engagement and

3100
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,640
post so that they can get engagement and
 

3101
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,190
post so that they can get engagement and
they can get likes and the engine itself

3102
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:35,200
they can get likes and the engine itself
 

3103
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,390
they can get likes and the engine itself
is engineered, excuse the pun, to reward

3104
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:38,400
is engineered, excuse the pun, to reward
 

3105
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,630
is engineered, excuse the pun, to reward
those types of posts and we end up with

3106
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:40,640
those types of posts and we end up with
 

3107
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,190
those types of posts and we end up with
that snowball effect of engagement being

3108
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:43,200
that snowball effect of engagement being
 

3109
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,230
that snowball effect of engagement being
rewarded. Um, if you are the kind of

3110
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:46,240
rewarded. Um, if you are the kind of
 

3111
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,309
rewarded. Um, if you are the kind of
person who can filter the signal from

3112
00:57:48,309 --> 00:57:48,319
person who can filter the signal from
 

3113
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:51,030
person who can filter the signal from
the noise and then who can encourage

3114
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:51,040
the noise and then who can encourage
 

3115
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:53,510
the noise and then who can encourage
others around the signal and not the

3116
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:53,520
others around the signal and not the
 

3117
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,870
others around the signal and not the
noise, that puts you in a huge advantage

3118
00:57:56,870 --> 00:57:56,880
noise, that puts you in a huge advantage
 

3119
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,109
noise, that puts you in a huge advantage
that makes you very distinctive. It's

3120
00:57:59,109 --> 00:57:59,119
that makes you very distinctive. It's
 

3121
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,589
that makes you very distinctive. It's
not as quickly and easily tangible as

3122
00:58:01,589 --> 00:58:01,599
not as quickly and easily tangible as
 

3123
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,990
not as quickly and easily tangible as
likes and engagements on social media.

3124
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:04,000

But when you're in a one-to-one

3126
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:05,359
But when you're in a one-to-one
 

3127
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,430
But when you're in a one-to-one
environment like a job interview or if

3128
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:07,440
environment like a job interview or if
 

3129
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,750
environment like a job interview or if
you are in a job and you are bringing

3130
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,760
you are in a job and you are bringing
 

3131
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,829
you are in a job and you are bringing
that signal to the table instead of the

00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:15,359
noise that makes you immensely valuable.

in with the idea of trying to filter
 

3139
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,630
in with the idea of trying to filter
that signal from the noise, trying to

so I'll take them to play golf. It's not
 

3279
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,630
so I'll take them to play golf. It's not
really that cliched, but there is a lot

3280
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:50,640
really that cliched, but there is a lot
 

3281
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,549
really that cliched, but there is a lot
of background that needs to be done. So,

3282
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:52,559
of background that needs to be done. So,
 

3283
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,309
of background that needs to be done. So,
I spoke with him and I spoke with their

3284
01:00:54,309 --> 01:00:54,319
I spoke with him and I spoke with their
 

3285
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:57,430
I spoke with him and I spoke with their
leading salespeople and found out that,

3286
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:57,440
leading salespeople and found out that,
 

3287
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,630
leading salespeople and found out that,
you know, and I asked the sales people,

3288
01:00:58,630 --> 01:00:58,640
you know, and I asked the sales people,
 

3289
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:00,950
you know, and I asked the sales people,
"What do you hate most about your job?"

3290
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:00,960
"What do you hate most about your job?"
 

3291
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,710
"What do you hate most about your job?"
and they were like, "Well, I hate the

3292
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:02,720
and they were like, "Well, I hate the
 

3293
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,630
and they were like, "Well, I hate the
fact that I have to waste all my time

3294
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:04,640
fact that I have to waste all my time
 

3295
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,190
fact that I have to waste all my time
going to visit these company websites,

3296
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:07,200
going to visit these company websites,
 

3297
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,829
going to visit these company websites,
going to look up people on LinkedIn, and

3298
01:01:09,829 --> 01:01:09,839
going to look up people on LinkedIn, and
 

3299
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:11,910
going to look up people on LinkedIn, and
every website is structured differently,

3300
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:11,920
every website is structured differently,
 

3301
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,670
every website is structured differently,
right? So, I can't like, you know, just

3302
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:13,680
right? So, I can't like, you know, just
 

3303
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:16,470
right? So, I can't like, you know, just
like have a path through a website that

3304
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:16,480
like have a path through a website that
 

3305
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,470
like have a path through a website that
I can follow. I have to take on all this

3306
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:18,480
I can follow. I have to take on all this
 

3307
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,190
I can follow. I have to take on all this
cognitive load." And they were spending

3308
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:21,200
cognitive load." And they were spending
 

3309
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,470
cognitive load." And they were spending
about 80% of their time researching and

3310
01:01:24,470 --> 01:01:24,480
about 80% of their time researching and
 

3311
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,870
about 80% of their time researching and
about 20% of their time selling. Oh, and

3312
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:26,880
about 20% of their time selling. Oh, and
 

3313
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,630
about 20% of their time selling. Oh, and
by the way, most salespeople don't get

3314
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:28,640
by the way, most salespeople don't get
 

3315
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,150
by the way, most salespeople don't get
paid very much. they have to make it up

3316
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:30,160
paid very much. they have to make it up
 

3317
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,069
paid very much. they have to make it up
by commission. So, they're only spending

3318
01:01:32,069 --> 01:01:32,079
by commission. So, they're only spending
 

3319
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,990
by commission. So, they're only spending
20% of their time doing the thing that

3320
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,000
20% of their time doing the thing that
 

3321
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,069
20% of their time doing the thing that
gets them commission directly. So, we're

3322
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:36,079
gets them commission directly. So, we're
 

3323
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:37,589
gets them commission directly. So, we're
like, okay, well, here's something now

3324
01:01:37,589 --> 01:01:37,599
like, okay, well, here's something now
 

3325
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,109
like, okay, well, here's something now
where we can start thinking about making

3326
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:39,119
where we can start thinking about making
 

3327
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:40,630
where we can start thinking about making
them more efficient by cutting into

3328
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:40,640
them more efficient by cutting into
 

3329
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,109
them more efficient by cutting into
that. So, we set a goal is like to make

3330
01:01:43,109 --> 01:01:43,119
that. So, we set a goal is like to make
 

3331
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,750
that. So, we set a goal is like to make
sales people 20% more efficient and then

3332
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:45,760
sales people 20% more efficient and then
 

3333
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,430
sales people 20% more efficient and then
we could start rolling out the ideas of

3334
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:47,440
we could start rolling out the ideas of
 

3335
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,349
we could start rolling out the ideas of
AI and then we could start rolling out

3336
01:01:49,349 --> 01:01:49,359
AI and then we could start rolling out
 

3337
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:51,750
AI and then we could start rolling out
the ideas of agentic AI. And quick

3338
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:51,760
the ideas of agentic AI. And quick
 

3339
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,150
the ideas of agentic AI. And quick
question, what's the difference between

3340
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:54,160
question, what's the difference between
 

3341
01:01:54,160 --> 01:02:01,349
question, what's the difference between
AI and agentic AI?

3342
01:02:01,349 --> 01:02:01,359

 

3343
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:07,270

Okay. So, yeah.

3344
01:02:07,270 --> 01:02:07,280

 

3345
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:11,430

>> Okay.

3346
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,440

 

3347
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,349

>> Yep. Excellent. Yeah. So, Agentic AI is

3348
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:13,359
>> Yep. Excellent. Yeah. So, Agentic AI is
 

3349
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:14,549
>> Yep. Excellent. Yeah. So, Agentic AI is
really about breaking it down into

3350
01:02:14,549 --> 01:02:14,559
really about breaking it down into
 

3351
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:16,870
really about breaking it down into
steps. Um, which is good engineering to

3352
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:16,880
steps. Um, which is good engineering to
 

3353
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:19,349
steps. Um, which is good engineering to
begin with, right? But in Agentic AI in

3354
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:19,359
begin with, right? But in Agentic AI in
 

3355
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,990
begin with, right? But in Agentic AI in
particular, I find there's a set pattern

3356
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:22,000
particular, I find there's a set pattern
 

3357
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,990
particular, I find there's a set pattern
of steps that if you follow them, you

3358
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:24,000
of steps that if you follow them, you
 

3359
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,750
of steps that if you follow them, you
end up with the whole idea of an agent.

3360
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:25,760
end up with the whole idea of an agent.
 

3361
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,349
end up with the whole idea of an agent.
The first of these steps is to

3362
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:27,359
The first of these steps is to
 

3363
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,829
The first of these steps is to
understand intent. You know, we tend to

3364
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:29,839
understand intent. You know, we tend to
 

3365
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:31,430
understand intent. You know, we tend to
use the words AI, artificial

3366
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:31,440
use the words AI, artificial
 

3367
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,109
use the words AI, artificial
intelligence a lot, but what large

3368
01:02:33,109 --> 01:02:33,119
intelligence a lot, but what large
 

3369
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,870
intelligence a lot, but what large
language models are really, really good

3370
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:34,880
language models are really, really good
 

3371
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,510
language models are really, really good
at is also understanding. So, if the

3372
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:37,520
at is also understanding. So, if the
 

3373
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:39,109
at is also understanding. So, if the
first step of anything that you want to

3374
01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:39,119
first step of anything that you want to
 

3375
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,589
first step of anything that you want to
do is to understand intent, right? And

3376
01:02:41,589 --> 01:02:41,599
do is to understand intent, right? And
 

3377
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:43,829
do is to understand intent, right? And
you can use an LLM to do that to kind of

3378
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:43,839
you can use an LLM to do that to kind of
 

3379
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:45,270
you can use an LLM to do that to kind of
think about this is the task that I need

3380
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:45,280
think about this is the task that I need
 

3381
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,549
think about this is the task that I need
to do, this is how I'm going to do it.

3382
01:02:46,549 --> 01:02:46,559
to do, this is how I'm going to do it.
 

3383
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,069
to do, this is how I'm going to do it.
Here's the intent. you know, I want to

3384
01:02:50,069 --> 01:02:50,079
Here's the intent. you know, I want to
 

3385
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,109
Here's the intent. you know, I want to
meet Bob Smith and sell widgets to Bob

3386
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:53,119
meet Bob Smith and sell widgets to Bob
 

3387
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:55,990
meet Bob Smith and sell widgets to Bob
Smith and this is like the what I know

3388
01:02:55,990 --> 01:02:56,000
Smith and this is like the what I know
 

3389
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,510
Smith and this is like the what I know
about Bob Smith. Help me with that

3390
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:57,520
about Bob Smith. Help me with that
 

3391
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,150
about Bob Smith. Help me with that
intent. The second part then is

3392
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:00,160
intent. The second part then is
 

3393
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,710
intent. The second part then is
planning, right? So you declare to an

3394
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:02,720
planning, right? So you declare to an
 

3395
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,950
planning, right? So you declare to an
agent what tools are available to it,

3396
01:03:04,950 --> 01:03:04,960
agent what tools are available to it,
 

3397
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:07,030
agent what tools are available to it,
browsing the web, searching the web, all

3398
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:07,040
browsing the web, searching the web, all
 

3399
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,430
browsing the web, searching the web, all
of these kind of things. And once you

3400
01:03:09,430 --> 01:03:09,440
of these kind of things. And once you
 

3401
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,430
of these kind of things. And once you
understand your clear intent to be able

3402
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:11,440
understand your clear intent to be able
 

3403
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,950
understand your clear intent to be able
to go to the step of planning and using

3404
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:12,960
to go to the step of planning and using
 

3405
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,109
to go to the step of planning and using
those tools for planning and an LLM is

3406
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:15,119
those tools for planning and an LLM is
 

3407
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:16,549
those tools for planning and an LLM is
very very good at then breaking that

3408
01:03:16,549 --> 01:03:16,559
very very good at then breaking that
 

3409
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,309
very very good at then breaking that
down into the steps that it needs to to

3410
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:18,319
down into the steps that it needs to to
 

3411
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,549
down into the steps that it needs to to
execute a plan. Search the web with

3412
01:03:20,549 --> 01:03:20,559
execute a plan. Search the web with
 

3413
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:23,270
execute a plan. Search the web with
these keywords. Browse this website and

3414
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:23,280
these keywords. Browse this website and
 

3415
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,069
these keywords. Browse this website and
find these links. Those types of things.

3416
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:26,079
find these links. Those types of things.
 

3417
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:27,670
find these links. Those types of things.
Once it's then figured out that plan,

3418
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:27,680
Once it's then figured out that plan,
 

3419
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,069
Once it's then figured out that plan,
then it uses the tools to get to a

3420
01:03:30,069 --> 01:03:30,079
then it uses the tools to get to a
 

3421
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,910
then it uses the tools to get to a
result. And then once it has the result,

3422
01:03:31,910 --> 01:03:31,920
result. And then once it has the result,
 

3423
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,670
result. And then once it has the result,
the fourth and final step is to reflect

3424
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:33,680
the fourth and final step is to reflect
 

3425
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,589
the fourth and final step is to reflect
on that result. and looking at the

3426
01:03:35,589 --> 01:03:35,599
on that result. and looking at the
 

3427
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:37,109
on that result. and looking at the
result and going back to the intent. Did

3428
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:37,119
result and going back to the intent. Did
 

3429
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,109
result and going back to the intent. Did
we meet the intent? Yes or no? If we

3430
01:03:39,109 --> 01:03:39,119
we meet the intent? Yes or no? If we
 

3431
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,270
we meet the intent? Yes or no? If we
didn't, then go back to that loop. All

3432
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:41,280
didn't, then go back to that loop. All
 

3433
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,430
didn't, then go back to that loop. All
agent is really broken down into those

3434
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:43,440
agent is really broken down into those
 

3435
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,029
agent is really broken down into those
things. And if you think about breaking

3436
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:45,039
things. And if you think about breaking
 

3437
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:47,190
things. And if you think about breaking
any problem down into those four steps,

3438
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:47,200
any problem down into those four steps,
 

3439
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,109
any problem down into those four steps,
that's when you start building an agent.

3440
01:03:49,109 --> 01:03:49,119
that's when you start building an agent.
 

3441
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:50,470
that's when you start building an agent.
And that was part of being a trusted

3442
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:50,480
And that was part of being a trusted
 

3443
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,549
And that was part of being a trusted
adviser. Instead of coming in and waving

3444
01:03:52,549 --> 01:03:52,559
adviser. Instead of coming in and waving
 

3445
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,150
adviser. Instead of coming in and waving
hands and saying, "Agent this, agent

3446
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:54,160
hands and saying, "Agent this, agent
 

3447
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,630
hands and saying, "Agent this, agent
that, look at this toolkit, save 20%."

3448
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:56,640
that, look at this toolkit, save 20%."
 

3449
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,990
that, look at this toolkit, save 20%."
You know, it's really to break it down

3450
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:58,000
You know, it's really to break it down
 

3451
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,150
You know, it's really to break it down
into those steps. So, we did. We broke

3452
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:00,160
into those steps. So, we did. We broke
 

3453
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,670
into those steps. So, we did. We broke
it down into those steps. We built a

3454
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:01,680
it down into those steps. We built a
 

3455
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,589
it down into those steps. We built a
pilot for the salespeople of this

3456
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:03,599
pilot for the salespeople of this
 

3457
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:04,789
pilot for the salespeople of this
company.

3458
01:04:04,789 --> 01:04:04,799
company.
 

3459
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,510
company.
and they ended up saving about between

3460
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:07,520
and they ended up saving about between
 

3461
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:10,230
and they ended up saving about between
10 and 15% of their time of their wasted

3462
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:10,240
10 and 15% of their time of their wasted
 

3463
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,109
10 and 15% of their time of their wasted
time. The doctrine of unintended

3464
01:04:13,109 --> 01:04:13,119
time. The doctrine of unintended
 

3465
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,950
time. The doctrine of unintended
consequences hit though after this and

3466
01:04:14,950 --> 01:04:14,960
consequences hit though after this and
 

3467
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,430
consequences hit though after this and
the unintended consequence was the

3468
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:17,440
the unintended consequence was the
 

3469
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,589
the unintended consequence was the
salespeople were much happier because

3470
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:19,599
salespeople were much happier because
 

3471
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,829
salespeople were much happier because
the average salesperson was making you

3472
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:21,839
the average salesperson was making you
 

3473
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:23,589
the average salesperson was making you
know several percentage points more

3474
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:23,599
know several percentage points more
 

3475
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,510
know several percentage points more
sales in a given week. They were earning

3476
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:25,520
sales in a given week. They were earning
 

3477
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,549
sales in a given week. They were earning
more money in a given week and their job

3478
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:28,559
more money in a given week and their job
 

3479
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,630
more money in a given week and their job
just became a little bit less miserable.

3480
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:30,640
just became a little bit less miserable.
 

3481
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,390
just became a little bit less miserable.
and then refinement to that agentic

3482
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:32,400
and then refinement to that agentic
 

3483
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,829
and then refinement to that agentic
process to be able to do all of that

3484
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:33,839
process to be able to do all of that

01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:35,680
research for them and to help give them

a brief in a few minutes instead of a

few hours to help them with the sales
 

3491
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,870
few hours to help them with the sales
process ended up being like a

3492
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:40,880
process ended up being like a
 

3493
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,109
process ended up being like a
win-win-win all around. But if you go in

3494
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:43,119
win-win-win all around. But if you go in
 

3495
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:44,789
win-win-win all around. But if you go in
being hypeled and like, oh, build an

3496
01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:44,799
being hypeled and like, oh, build an
 

3497
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,309
being hypeled and like, oh, build an
agent for the thing without really

3498
01:04:46,309 --> 01:04:46,319
agent for the thing without really

peeling apart the business requirements,

3500
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:49,280
peeling apart the business requirements,
 

3501
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,910
peeling apart the business requirements,
the why, the what, the how, and all of

01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:51,920
the why, the what, the how, and all of
 

3503
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,990
the why, the what, the how, and all of
these kind of things, we ended up like,

3504
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:54,000
these kind of things, we ended up like,
 

3505
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,270
these kind of things, we ended up like,
you know, this company just would have

3506
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:55,280
you know, this company just would have
 

3507
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,190
you know, this company just would have
been lost in hype. You've probably seen

3508
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:57,200
been lost in hype. You've probably seen
 

3509
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,109
been lost in hype. You've probably seen
reports recently. I think McKenzie put

3510
01:04:59,109 --> 01:04:59,119
reports recently. I think McKenzie put
 

3511
01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:01,910
reports recently. I think McKenzie put
one out last week showing that about 85%

3512
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:01,920
one out last week showing that about 85%
 

3513
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,430
one out last week showing that about 85%
of AI projects at companies fail. Um,

3514
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:05,440
of AI projects at companies fail. Um,
 

3515
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,430
of AI projects at companies fail. Um,
and part of the main reason for that is

3516
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:07,440
and part of the main reason for that is
 

3517
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,430
and part of the main reason for that is
that they're not well scoped. People are

3518
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
that they're not well scoped. People are
 

3519
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,109
that they're not well scoped. People are
jumping on the hype bandwagon and

3520
01:05:11,109 --> 01:05:11,119
jumping on the hype bandwagon and
 

3521
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,630
jumping on the hype bandwagon and
they're not really understanding their

3522
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:12,640
they're not really understanding their
 

3523
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,549
they're not really understanding their
way through the problem. And I think you

3524
01:05:14,549 --> 01:05:14,559
way through the problem. And I think you
 

3525
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,710
way through the problem. And I think you
know the big brains in this room and the

3526
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:16,720
know the big brains in this room and the
 

3527
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,950
know the big brains in this room and the
network that you folks have, a really

3528
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
network that you folks have, a really
 

3529
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,109
network that you folks have, a really
key component of being able to succeed

3530
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:21,119
key component of being able to succeed
 

3531
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,789
key component of being able to succeed
is to understand your way through that

3532
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:22,799
is to understand your way through that
 

3533
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:25,270
is to understand your way through that
problem. So that was a hype example

3534
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:25,280
problem. So that was a hype example
 

3535
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:27,589
problem. So that was a hype example
around Agentic that I was thankfully

3536
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:27,599
around Agentic that I was thankfully
 

3537
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:29,750
around Agentic that I was thankfully
able to help this company through. Other

3538
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:29,760
able to help this company through. Other
 

3539
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,270
able to help this company through. Other
recent hype examples you've probably

3540
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:31,280
recent hype examples you've probably
 

3541
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,349
recent hype examples you've probably
seen the software engineering is dead.

3542
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:33,359
seen the software engineering is dead.
 

3543
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:35,750
seen the software engineering is dead.
My personal favorite Hollywood is dead

3544
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:35,760
My personal favorite Hollywood is dead
 

3545

3547
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:41,589

Arabia this time last year at a thing

3548
01:05:41,589 --> 01:05:41,599
Arabia this time last year at a thing
 

3549
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,990
Arabia this time last year at a thing
called the FI and it was a dinner at the

3550
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:44,000
called the FI and it was a dinner at the
 

3551
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,029
called the FI and it was a dinner at the
FI and I sat beside the CEO of a company

3552
01:05:47,029 --> 01:05:47,039
FI and I sat beside the CEO of a company
 

3553
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:49,029
FI and I sat beside the CEO of a company
who I'm not going to name, but this was

3554
01:05:49,029 --> 01:05:49,039
who I'm not going to name, but this was
 

3555
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:51,910
who I'm not going to name, but this was
a CEO of a generative AI company and at

3556
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:51,920
a CEO of a generative AI company and at
 

3557
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,510
a CEO of a generative AI company and at
that time he was showing everybody

3558
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:53,520
that time he was showing everybody
 

3559
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,670
that time he was showing everybody
around the table this thing that he'd

3560
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:55,680
around the table this thing that he'd
 

3561
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,990
around the table this thing that he'd
done where it was text to video and he

3562
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,000
done where it was text to video and he
 

3563
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,230
done where it was text to video and he
could put in a text prompt and get video

3564
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:00,240
could put in a text prompt and get video
 

3565
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,910
could put in a text prompt and get video
out of the prompt and get about six

3566
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:01,920
out of the prompt and get about six
 

3567
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,910
out of the prompt and get about six
seconds worth of video out of it. Year

3568
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:03,920
seconds worth of video out of it. Year
 

3569
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,230
seconds worth of video out of it. Year
ago, that was I beg you pardon two years

3570
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:06,240
ago, that was I beg you pardon two years
 

3571
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,150
ago, that was I beg you pardon two years
ago. two years ago that was hot stuff.

3572
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:08,160
ago. two years ago that was hot stuff.
 

3573
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,630
ago. two years ago that was hot stuff.
Nowadays obviously it's quite p anybody

3574
01:06:10,630 --> 01:06:10,640
Nowadays obviously it's quite p anybody
 

3575
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:13,109
Nowadays obviously it's quite p anybody
can do it. But he made a comment at that

3576
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:13,119
can do it. But he made a comment at that
 

3577
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,829
can do it. But he made a comment at that
table and it was a lot of like um media

3578
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:15,839
table and it was a lot of like um media
 

3579
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,510
table and it was a lot of like um media
executives at that table was like by

this time next year from a single prompt
 

3583
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,470
this time next year from a single prompt
we'll be able to do 90 minutes of video

3584
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:22,480
we'll be able to do 90 minutes of video
 

3585
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,710
we'll be able to do 90 minutes of video

years later from a prompt and even if

3594
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:32,240
years later from a prompt and even if
 

3595
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,589
years later from a prompt and even if
you did what kind of prompt would be

3596
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:33,599
you did what kind of prompt would be

something like this, try to figure out

3648
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:33,200
something like this, try to figure out
 

3649
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,910
something like this, try to figure out
how to make it as mundane as possible.

3650
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:35,920
how to make it as mundane as possible.
 

3651
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,270
how to make it as mundane as possible.
When you can figure out how to make it

3652
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:37,280
When you can figure out how to make it
 

3653
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,349
When you can figure out how to make it
as mundane as possible, then you really

3654
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:39,359
as mundane as possible, then you really
 

3655
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,670
as mundane as possible, then you really
begin to build the grounding for being

3656
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:41,680
begin to build the grounding for being
 

3657
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,990
begin to build the grounding for being
able to explain it in detail in ways

3658
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:44,000
able to explain it in detail in ways
 

3659
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,710
able to explain it in detail in ways
that people need to understand, right?

3660
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:46,720
that people need to understand, right?
 

3661
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,270
that people need to understand, right?
Like if I you you go and you look at you

3662
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:49,280
Like if I you you go and you look at you
 

3663
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,069
Like if I you you go and you look at you
know I think Gemini 3 um was released

3664
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:52,079
know I think Gemini 3 um was released
 

3665
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:54,150
know I think Gemini 3 um was released
today but there were leaks earlier this

3666
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:54,160
today but there were leaks earlier this
 

3667
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:56,549
today but there were leaks earlier this
week and one person kind of leaked that

3668
01:07:56,549 --> 01:07:56,559
week and one person kind of leaked that

I built a Minecraft clone and a prompt

3670
01:07:59,190 --> 01:07:59,200
I built a Minecraft clone and a prompt
 

3671
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,630
I built a Minecraft clone and a prompt
you know that kind of stuff. This is the

3672
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:00,640
you know that kind of stuff. This is the
 

3673
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:02,710
you know that kind of stuff. This is the
opposite of mundane, right? This was

3674
01:08:02,710 --> 01:08:02,720
opposite of mundane, right? This was
 

3675
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,309
opposite of mundane, right? This was
like massively hyping the thing,

3676
01:08:04,309 --> 01:08:04,319
like massively hyping the thing,
 

3677
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:05,990
like massively hyping the thing,
massively showing, and of course they

3678
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:06,000
massively showing, and of course they
 

3679
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,430
massively showing, and of course they
didn't. They built a flashy demo. They

3680
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:07,440
didn't. They built a flashy demo. They
 

3681
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,349
didn't. They built a flashy demo. They
didn't really build a Minecraft clone.

3682
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:09,359
didn't really build a Minecraft clone.
 

3683
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:10,870
didn't really build a Minecraft clone.
But the idea here is if you can peel

3684
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:10,880
But the idea here is if you can peel
 

3685
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:13,430
But the idea here is if you can peel
that apart to like, okay, how do I think

3686
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:13,440
that apart to like, okay, how do I think
 

3687
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,430
that apart to like, okay, how do I think
about what are the mundane things that

3688
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:15,440
about what are the mundane things that
 

3689
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,070
about what are the mundane things that
are happening here? Um, the the one that

3690
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:18,080
are happening here? Um, the the one that
 

3691
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:19,910
are happening here? Um, the the one that
I've been working with a lot recently is

3692
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:19,920
I've been working with a lot recently is
 

3693
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,470
I've been working with a lot recently is
video. So text to video prompts, as I've

3694
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:22,480
video. So text to video prompts, as I've
 

3695
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,829
video. So text to video prompts, as I've
mentioned, instead of the magical you

3696
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839
mentioned, instead of the magical you
 

3697
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,590
mentioned, instead of the magical you
can do whatever you want, all nice and

3698
01:08:27,590 --> 01:08:27,600
can do whatever you want, all nice and
 

3699
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,910
can do whatever you want, all nice and
fluffy, Hollywood is dead. What is the

3700
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:29,920
fluffy, Hollywood is dead. What is the
 

3701
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,829
fluffy, Hollywood is dead. What is the
mundane element of doing text to video?

3702
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:31,839
mundane element of doing text to video?
 

3703
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,349
mundane element of doing text to video?
The mundane element of doing text to

3704
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:33,359
The mundane element of doing text to
 

3705
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,550
The mundane element of doing text to
video is that when you train a model to

3706
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:36,560
video is that when you train a model to
 

3707
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,789
video is that when you train a model to
create video from a text prompt, what it

3708
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:38,799
create video from a text prompt, what it
 

3709
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,550
create video from a text prompt, what it
is doing is it's creating a number of

3710
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:40,560
is doing is it's creating a number of
 

3711
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,470
is doing is it's creating a number of
successive frames. And each of those

3712
01:08:42,470 --> 01:08:42,480
successive frames. And each of those
 

3713
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,309
successive frames. And each of those
successive frames is going to be

3714
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:44,319
successive frames is going to be
 

3715
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,590
successive frames is going to be
slightly different from the frame

3716
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:45,600
slightly different from the frame
 

3717
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,149
slightly different from the frame
before. And you've trained a model by

3718
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:48,159
before. And you've trained a model by
 

3719
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:50,070
before. And you've trained a model by
looking at video to say, well, you know,

3720
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:50,080
looking at video to say, well, you know,
 

3721
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,749
looking at video to say, well, you know,
if in frame one the person's hands like

3722
01:08:51,749 --> 01:08:51,759
if in frame one the person's hands like
 

3723
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:53,669
if in frame one the person's hands like
this, in frame two it's like that, then

3724
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:53,679
this, in frame two it's like that, then
 

3725
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:55,189
this, in frame two it's like that, then
you can predict it moves this way if

3726
01:08:55,189 --> 01:08:55,199
you can predict it moves this way if
 

3727
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:57,110
you can predict it moves this way if
there's a matching prompt. And suddenly

3728
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:57,120
there's a matching prompt. And suddenly
 

3729
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:58,870
there's a matching prompt. And suddenly
it's become a little bit more mundane,

3730
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:58,880
it's become a little bit more mundane,
 

3731
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,630
it's become a little bit more mundane,
but suddenly they begin to understand

3732
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:00,640
but suddenly they begin to understand
 

3733
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,550
but suddenly they begin to understand
it. And then the people who are experts

3734
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:02,560
it. And then the people who are experts
 

3735
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,149
it. And then the people who are experts
in that specific field, not the

3736
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:04,159
in that specific field, not the
 

3737
01:09:04,159 --> 01:09:06,149
in that specific field, not the
technical side of it, are now the ones

3738
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:06,159
technical side of it, are now the ones
 

3739
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:08,229
technical side of it, are now the ones
that will actually be able to come up

3740
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:08,239
that will actually be able to come up
 

3741
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:11,110
that will actually be able to come up
and do brilliant things with it.

3742
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:11,120
and do brilliant things with it.
 

3743
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,910
and do brilliant things with it.
So that hype navigation strategy, filter

3744
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:13,920
So that hype navigation strategy, filter
 

3745
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,630
So that hype navigation strategy, filter
actively, go deep on the fundamentals,

3746
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:16,640
actively, go deep on the fundamentals,
 

3747
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,470
actively, go deep on the fundamentals,
get your slides to work, and then of

3748
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:18,480
get your slides to work, and then of
 

3749
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:19,910
get your slides to work, and then of
course keep your finger on the pulse.

3750
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:19,920
course keep your finger on the pulse.
 

3751
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,269
course keep your finger on the pulse.
The hardest part of that, I think, is

3752
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:21,279
The hardest part of that, I think, is
 

3753
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,630
The hardest part of that, I think, is
the third one is really keeping your

3754
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:22,640
the third one is really keeping your
 

3755
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,070
the third one is really keeping your
finger on the pulse. And that's when you

3756
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:24,080
finger on the pulse. And that's when you
 

3757
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,229
finger on the pulse. And that's when you
have to wait into those cess pits of

3758
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:26,239
have to wait into those cess pits of
 

3759
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:28,390
have to wait into those cess pits of
people like just farming engagement and

3760
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:28,400
people like just farming engagement and
 

3761
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:29,910
people like just farming engagement and
really try to figure out the signal from

3762
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:29,920
really try to figure out the signal from
 

3763
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,430
really try to figure out the signal from
the noise there. But I think it's really

3764
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:31,440
the noise there. But I think it's really
 

3765
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:32,950
the noise there. But I think it's really
important for you to be able to do that

3766
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:32,960
important for you to be able to do that
 

3767
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,030
important for you to be able to do that
to be connected to understand that

3768
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:35,040
to be connected to understand that
 

3769
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,630
to be connected to understand that
reading papers is all very good. The

3770
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:36,640
reading papers is all very good. The
 

3771
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,309
reading papers is all very good. The
signal to noise ratio I think in reading

3772
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:38,319
signal to noise ratio I think in reading
 

3773
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:40,229
signal to noise ratio I think in reading
papers is a lot better. But to

3774
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:40,239
papers is a lot better. But to
 

3775
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:41,910
papers is a lot better. But to
understand the landscape that the people

3776
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:41,920
understand the landscape that the people
 

3777
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,229
understand the landscape that the people
that you are advising, they are the ones

3778
01:09:44,229 --> 01:09:44,239
that you are advising, they are the ones
 

3779
01:09:44,239 --> 01:09:45,829
that you are advising, they are the ones
who are waiting in the cesspools of

3780
01:09:45,829 --> 01:09:45,839
who are waiting in the cesspools of
 

3781
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:48,470
who are waiting in the cesspools of
Twitter and X and LinkedIn and there's

3782
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:48,480
Twitter and X and LinkedIn and there's
 

3783
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,829
Twitter and X and LinkedIn and there's
nothing wrong with those platforms in

3784
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:49,839
nothing wrong with those platforms in
 

3785
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:51,430
nothing wrong with those platforms in
and of themselves, but the stuff that's

3786
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:51,440
and of themselves, but the stuff that's
 

3787
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,709
and of themselves, but the stuff that's
posted on those platforms.

3788
01:09:54,709 --> 01:09:54,719
posted on those platforms.
 

3789
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,229
posted on those platforms.
So

3790
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:56,239
So
 

3791
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,310
So
overall landscape,

3792
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:58,320
overall landscape,
 

3793
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,110
overall landscape,
it is ripe with opportunity. Absolutely

3794
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:01,120
it is ripe with opportunity. Absolutely
 

3795
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:03,350
it is ripe with opportunity. Absolutely
ripe with opportunity. Um, so I would

3796
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:03,360
ripe with opportunity. Um, so I would
 

3797
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,510
ripe with opportunity. Um, so I would
encourage you as Andrew did to continue

3798
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:05,520
encourage you as Andrew did to continue
 

3799
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,669
encourage you as Andrew did to continue
learning, to continue digging into what

3800
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:07,679
learning, to continue digging into what
 

3801
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:10,149
learning, to continue digging into what
you can do and to continue building. But

3802
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:10,159
you can do and to continue building. But
 

3803
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:13,110
you can do and to continue building. But
there are risks ahead, right? You know

3804
01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:13,120
there are risks ahead, right? You know
 

3805
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,870
there are risks ahead, right? You know
the have anybody remember the movie

3806
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:14,880
the have anybody remember the movie
 

3807
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,630
the have anybody remember the movie
Titanic?

3808
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:16,640
Titanic?
 

3809
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,070
Titanic?
Remember the famous phrase in that

3810
01:10:18,070 --> 01:10:18,080
Remember the famous phrase in that
 

3811
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,310
Remember the famous phrase in that
iceberg right ahead. You know, but

3812
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:20,320
iceberg right ahead. You know, but
 

3813
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,310
iceberg right ahead. You know, but
immediately before that, there's a scene

3814
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:22,320
immediately before that, there's a scene
 

3815
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,550
immediately before that, there's a scene
in Titanic. If we weren't being filmed,

3816
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:24,560
in Titanic. If we weren't being filmed,
 

3817
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,310
in Titanic. If we weren't being filmed,
I would show it, but I can't uh for

3818
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:26,320
I would show it, but I can't uh for
 

3819
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,149
I would show it, but I can't uh for
copyright reasons, where the two guys up

3820
01:10:28,149 --> 01:10:28,159
copyright reasons, where the two guys up
 

3821
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:29,990
copyright reasons, where the two guys up
in the crow's nests are kind of like

3822
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:30,000
in the crow's nests are kind of like
 

3823
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,910
in the crow's nests are kind of like
freezing and talking. And like the

3824
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:31,920
freezing and talking. And like the
 

3825
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,430
freezing and talking. And like the
crow's nest at the top of the ship is

3826
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:33,440
crow's nest at the top of the ship is
 

3827
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:35,189
crow's nest at the top of the ship is
where the spotters would be to spot any

3828
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:35,199
where the spotters would be to spot any
 

3829
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:37,510
where the spotters would be to spot any
icebergs in front. And go back and watch

3830
01:10:37,510 --> 01:10:37,520
icebergs in front. And go back and watch
 

3831
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,630
icebergs in front. And go back and watch
the movie again. You'll see the

3832
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:38,640
the movie again. You'll see the
 

3833
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,630
the movie again. You'll see the
conversation between these two guys is

3834
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:40,640
conversation between these two guys is
 

3835
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,910
conversation between these two guys is
that all they're talking about is how

3836
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:41,920
that all they're talking about is how
 

3837
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,709
that all they're talking about is how
cold they are. Um, and then it cuts away

3838
01:10:44,709 --> 01:10:44,719
cold they are. Um, and then it cuts away
 

3839
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:46,630
cold they are. Um, and then it cuts away
to the crew of the ship who are like,

3840
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:46,640
to the crew of the ship who are like,
 

3841
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:47,990
to the crew of the ship who are like,
"Wait, aren't they supposed to have

3842
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:48,000
"Wait, aren't they supposed to have
 

3843
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,910
"Wait, aren't they supposed to have
binoculars?" you know, and then the crew

3844
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:49,920
binoculars?" you know, and then the crew
 

3845
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,270
binoculars?" you know, and then the crew
was like, "Oh, we left the binoculars

3846
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:51,280
was like, "Oh, we left the binoculars
 

3847
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,550
was like, "Oh, we left the binoculars
behind in port." That framing the whole

3848
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:54,560
behind in port." That framing the whole
 

3849
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,870
behind in port." That framing the whole
idea was like they were so arrogant in

3850
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:56,880
idea was like they were so arrogant in
 

3851
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,630
idea was like they were so arrogant in
being able to move forward that they

3852
01:10:58,630 --> 01:10:58,640
being able to move forward that they
 

3853
01:10:58,640 --> 01:10:59,750
being able to move forward that they
didn't want to look out for any

3854
01:10:59,750 --> 01:10:59,760
didn't want to look out for any
 

3855
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,430
didn't want to look out for any
particular risks. And even though they

3856
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:01,440
particular risks. And even though they
 

3857
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,950
particular risks. And even though they
had people whose job it was to look out

3858
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:02,960
had people whose job it was to look out
 

3859
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,950
had people whose job it was to look out
for risks, they didn't properly equip or

3860
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:04,960
for risks, they didn't properly equip or
 

3861
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,270
for risks, they didn't properly equip or
train them. And that to me is a really

3862
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:07,280
train them. And that to me is a really
 

3863
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,110
train them. And that to me is a really
good metaphor for where the AI industry

3864
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:09,120
good metaphor for where the AI industry
 

3865
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,510
good metaphor for where the AI industry
is today. There are risks in front of

3866
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:11,520
is today. There are risks in front of
 

3867
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,990
is today. There are risks in front of
us. Um, those risks, the B- word, the

3868
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:14,000
us. Um, those risks, the B- word, the
 

3869
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,510
us. Um, those risks, the B- word, the
bubble word you're probably reading in

3870
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:15,520
bubble word you're probably reading in
 

3871
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,470
bubble word you're probably reading in
the news is there are there. Um to me

3872
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:18,480
the news is there are there. Um to me
 

3873
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:22,229
the news is there are there. Um to me
though the opportunity and the um

3874
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:22,239
though the opportunity and the um
 

3875
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,470
though the opportunity and the um
the uh the things to think about in

3876
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:24,480
the uh the things to think about in
 

3877
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,510
the uh the things to think about in
terms of a bubble are most of you

3878
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:27,520
terms of a bubble are most of you
 

3879
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,669
terms of a bubble are most of you
probably don't remember the dot bubble

3880
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:29,679
probably don't remember the dot bubble
 

3881
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:32,310
probably don't remember the dot bubble
of the 2000s but if you think about the

3882
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:32,320
of the 2000s but if you think about the
 

3883
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,590
of the 2000s but if you think about the
dot bubble that was the biggest bubble

3884
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:35,600
dot bubble that was the biggest bubble
 

3885
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,470
dot bubble that was the biggest bubble
in history it burst

3886
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:38,480
in history it burst
 

3887
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:41,590
in history it burst
but we're still here and the people who

3888
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:41,600
but we're still here and the people who
 

3889
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:45,189
but we're still here and the people who
did com rights not only survived they

3890
01:11:45,189 --> 01:11:45,199
did com rights not only survived they
 

3891
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:48,870
did com rights not only survived they
thrived. Amazon, Google, you know, they

3892
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:48,880
thrived. Amazon, Google, you know, they
 

3893
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,790
thrived. Amazon, Google, you know, they
did it right. They understood the

3894
01:11:50,790 --> 01:11:50,800
did it right. They understood the
 

3895
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,390
did it right. They understood the
fundamentals of what it was to build

3896
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:52,400
fundamentals of what it was to build
 

3897
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,470
fundamentals of what it was to build
a.com. They understood the fundamentals

3898
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:54,480
a.com. They understood the fundamentals
 

3899
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,830
a.com. They understood the fundamentals
of what it was to build a business

3900
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:55,840
of what it was to build a business
 

3901
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,910
of what it was to build a business
on.com. And when the bubble of hype

3902
01:11:57,910 --> 01:11:57,920
on.com. And when the bubble of hype
 

3903
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,669
on.com. And when the bubble of hype
burst, they didn't go with it. There was

3904
01:11:59,669 --> 01:11:59,679
burst, they didn't go with it. There was
 

3905
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:02,390
burst, they didn't go with it. There was
one website, I believe it was pets.com,

3906
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:02,400
one website, I believe it was pets.com,
 

3907
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,189
one website, I believe it was pets.com,
that they had the mindset of if you

3908
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:05,199
that they had the mindset of if you
 

3909
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:07,350
that they had the mindset of if you
build it, they will come. They had Super

3910
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:07,360
build it, they will come. They had Super
 

3911
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,310
build it, they will come. They had Super
Bowl commercials around pets.com. They

3912
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:10,320
Bowl commercials around pets.com. They
 

3913
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,590
Bowl commercials around pets.com. They
couldn't handle the traffic that they

3914
01:12:11,590 --> 01:12:11,600
couldn't handle the traffic that they
 

3915
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:13,830
couldn't handle the traffic that they
got. And that was the kind of site that

3916
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:13,840
got. And that was the kind of site that
 

3917
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,669
got. And that was the kind of site that
when the when the bubble burst, those

3918
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:15,679
when the when the bubble burst, those
 

3919
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:16,790
when the when the bubble burst, those
were the kind of sites that just

3920
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:16,800
were the kind of sites that just
 

3921
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:19,510
were the kind of sites that just
evaporated. So that bubble in AI is

3922
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:19,520
evaporated. So that bubble in AI is
 

3923
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,390
evaporated. So that bubble in AI is
likely coming. There is always a bubble.

3924
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:22,400
likely coming. There is always a bubble.
 

3925
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:25,430
likely coming. There is always a bubble.
So the companies that are doing AI right

3926
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:25,440
So the companies that are doing AI right
 

3927
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,910
So the companies that are doing AI right
are the ones like I said that won't just

3928
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:27,920
are the ones like I said that won't just
 

3929
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,550
are the ones like I said that won't just
you know um avoid the bubble that they

3930
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:30,560
you know um avoid the bubble that they
 

3931
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,750
you know um avoid the bubble that they
will actually thrive uh postbubble. and

3932
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:33,760
will actually thrive uh postbubble. and
 

3933
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:37,189
will actually thrive uh postbubble. and
the people who are doing AI right, the

3934
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:37,199
the people who are doing AI right, the
 

3935
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:38,790
the people who are doing AI right, the
folks in this room who are thinking

3936
01:12:38,790 --> 01:12:38,800
folks in this room who are thinking
 

3937
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,470
folks in this room who are thinking
about AI and how you bring it to your

3938
01:12:40,470 --> 01:12:40,480
about AI and how you bring it to your
 

3939
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,149
about AI and how you bring it to your
company and the advice that you're

3940
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:42,159
company and the advice that you're
 

3941
01:12:42,159 --> 01:12:43,830
company and the advice that you're
giving to your company and leaning into

3942
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:43,840
giving to your company and leaning into
 

3943
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,070
giving to your company and leaning into
that in the right way will also be the

3944
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:46,080
that in the right way will also be the
 

3945
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:48,630
that in the right way will also be the
ones who not only avoid getting laid off

3946
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:48,640
ones who not only avoid getting laid off
 

3947
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,790
ones who not only avoid getting laid off
in the bubble crashes but the what will

3948
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:50,800
in the bubble crashes but the what will
 

3949
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,430
in the bubble crashes but the what will
be the ones who will thrive through and

3950
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:53,440
be the ones who will thrive through and
 

3951
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:56,070
be the ones who will thrive through and
after the bubble. So anatomy of any

3952
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:56,080
after the bubble. So anatomy of any
 

3953
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,070
after the bubble. So anatomy of any
bubble and what I'm seeing in the AI one

3954
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:58,080
bubble and what I'm seeing in the AI one
 

3955
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,310
bubble and what I'm seeing in the AI one
in particular is this kind of pyramid.

3956
01:13:00,310 --> 01:13:00,320
in particular is this kind of pyramid.
 

3957
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,830
in particular is this kind of pyramid.
At the top is the hype that I've been

3958
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:01,840
At the top is the hype that I've been
 

3959
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,390
At the top is the hype that I've been
talking about. At the bottom is massive

3960
01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:04,400
talking about. At the bottom is massive
 

3961
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,709
talking about. At the bottom is massive
VC investment. I'll be frank, I'm

3962
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:06,719
VC investment. I'll be frank, I'm
 

3963
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,790
VC investment. I'll be frank, I'm
already seeing that drying up, right?

3964
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:08,800
already seeing that drying up, right?
 

3965
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,630
already seeing that drying up, right?
You know, once upon a time you could go

3966
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:10,640
You know, once upon a time you could go
 

3967
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,310
You know, once upon a time you could go
out with anything that had AI written on

3968
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:12,320
out with anything that had AI written on
 

3969
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,550
out with anything that had AI written on
it and get VC investment. Then you could

3970
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:14,560
it and get VC investment. Then you could
 

3971
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,229
it and get VC investment. Then you could
go out and do anything with an LLM and

3972
01:13:16,229 --> 01:13:16,239
go out and do anything with an LLM and
 

3973
01:13:16,239 --> 01:13:18,950
go out and do anything with an LLM and
get VC investment. Now they're far far

3974
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:18,960
get VC investment. Now they're far far
 

3975
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,910
get VC investment. Now they're far far
far more cautious. I've been advising a

3976
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:21,920
far more cautious. I've been advising a
 

3977
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,070
far more cautious. I've been advising a
lot of startups. The amount that they're

3978
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:24,080
lot of startups. The amount that they're
 

3979
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,470
lot of startups. The amount that they're
getting invested is being scaled back.

3980
01:13:26,470 --> 01:13:26,480
getting invested is being scaled back.
 

3981
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,470
getting invested is being scaled back.
Um the uh the stuff that's being

3982
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:28,480
Um the uh the stuff that's being
 

3983
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:31,910
Um the uh the stuff that's being
invested in is changing and you know the

3984
01:13:31,910 --> 01:13:31,920
invested in is changing and you know the
 

3985
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,149
invested in is changing and you know the
you know this the second layer down

3986
01:13:34,149 --> 01:13:34,159
you know this the second layer down
 

3987
01:13:34,159 --> 01:13:35,830
you know this the second layer down
massive VC investment is already

3988
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:35,840
massive VC investment is already
 

3989
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,229
massive VC investment is already
beginning to vanish. Unrealistic

3990
01:13:38,229 --> 01:13:38,239
beginning to vanish. Unrealistic
 

3991
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,709
beginning to vanish. Unrealistic
valuations companies that aren't making

3992
01:13:40,709 --> 01:13:40,719
valuations companies that aren't making
 

3993
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:43,350
valuations companies that aren't making
money being valued massively high. We

3994
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:43,360
money being valued massively high. We
 

3995
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,110
money being valued massively high. We
all know who they are. You know we're

3996
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:45,120
all know who they are. You know we're
 

3997
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,630
all know who they are. You know we're
beginning to see those unrealistic

3998
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:46,640
beginning to see those unrealistic
 

3999
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,189
beginning to see those unrealistic
valuations being fed off of that hype.

4000
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:49,199
valuations being fed off of that hype.
 

4001
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,750
valuations being fed off of that hype.
me too products where somebody does

4002
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:51,760
me too products where somebody does
 

4003
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,189
me too products where somebody does
something and it's successful and

4004
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:53,199
something and it's successful and
 

4005
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:55,110
something and it's successful and
everybody jumps on the bandwagon. We're

4006
01:13:55,110 --> 01:13:55,120
everybody jumps on the bandwagon. We're
 

4007
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:57,030
everybody jumps on the bandwagon. We're
also seeing them everywhere. We saw them

4008
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:57,040
also seeing them everywhere. We saw them
 

4009
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,350
also seeing them everywhere. We saw them
throughout the dotcom bubble, right? And

4010
01:13:59,350 --> 01:13:59,360
throughout the dotcom bubble, right? And
 

4011
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,030
throughout the dotcom bubble, right? And
then right at the bottom is that real

4012
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:01,040
then right at the bottom is that real
 

4013
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,870
then right at the bottom is that real
value. You know, I probably shouldn't

4014
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:02,880
value. You know, I probably shouldn't
 

4015
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,630
value. You know, I probably shouldn't
have done a the triangle like this. It

4016
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:04,640
have done a the triangle like this. It
 

4017
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,390
have done a the triangle like this. It
should be more an upside down triangle,

4018
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:06,400
should be more an upside down triangle,
 

4019
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:08,070
should be more an upside down triangle,
right? Because you know the uh the real

4020
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:08,080
right? Because you know the uh the real
 

4021
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:10,070
right? Because you know the uh the real
value here is small. I vibe coded these

4022
01:14:10,070 --> 01:14:10,080
value here is small. I vibe coded these
 

4023
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,070
value here is small. I vibe coded these
slides into existence. So this is one of

4024
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,080
slides into existence. So this is one of
 

4025
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,390
slides into existence. So this is one of
the technical debt I took on um you know

4026
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400
the technical debt I took on um you know
 

4027
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,470
the technical debt I took on um you know
so the but the real value there that

4028
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:16,480
so the but the real value there that
 

4029
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,470
so the but the real value there that
that kernel of value is there and the

4030
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:18,480
that kernel of value is there and the
 

4031
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,310
that kernel of value is there and the
ones that build for that will be the

4032
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:20,320
ones that build for that will be the
 

4033
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:23,030
ones that build for that will be the
ones that survive.

4034
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:23,040
ones that survive.
 

4035
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,750
ones that survive.
So

4036
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:25,760
So
 

4037
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:27,830
So
the direction that I see the AI industry

4038
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:27,840
the direction that I see the AI industry
 

4039
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,390
the direction that I see the AI industry
going in um and the direction that I

4040
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:30,400
going in um and the direction that I
 

4041
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,669
going in um and the direction that I
encourage you to start thinking about

4042
01:14:31,669 --> 01:14:31,679
encourage you to start thinking about
 

4043
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,430
encourage you to start thinking about
your skills in is really over the next

4044
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:33,440
your skills in is really over the next
 

4045
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:34,470
your skills in is really over the next
five years there's going to be a

4046
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:34,480
five years there's going to be a
 

4047
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:37,030
five years there's going to be a
bifurcation. Okay, it's gonna I'm just

4048
01:14:37,030 --> 01:14:37,040
bifurcation. Okay, it's gonna I'm just
 

4049
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,430
bifurcation. Okay, it's gonna I'm just
gonna be ornery in how I describe them

4050
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:39,440
gonna be ornery in how I describe them
 

4051
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:42,070
gonna be ornery in how I describe them

the desire to drive towards AGI. The

4058
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:48,800
the desire to drive towards AGI. The
 

4059
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:51,910
the desire to drive towards AGI. The
Geminis, the clouds, the open AIs of the

01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:51,920
Geminis, the clouds, the open AIs of the
 

4061
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,430
Geminis, the clouds, the open AIs of the

bigger and bigger is better in the

01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:56,000
bigger and bigger is better in the
 

4065
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,470
bigger and bigger is better in the
mindset of those companies towards

4066
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:58,480
mindset of those companies towards
 

4067
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,630
mindset of those companies towards
achieving AGI or towards achieving

01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:00,640
achieving AGI or towards achieving
 

4069
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,310
achieving AGI or towards achieving
better business value. That's going to

4070
01:15:02,310 --> 01:15:02,320
better business value. That's going to
 

4071
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,750
better business value. That's going to
be one side of the branch. The other

4072
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:03,760
be one side of the branch. The other
 

4073
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,950
be one side of the branch. The other
side of the branch is I'm going to call

4074
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:04,960
side of the branch is I'm going to call
 

4075
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,270
side of the branch is I'm going to call
it small. We've all seen open source

4076
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:07,280
it small. We've all seen open source
 

4077
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:10,390
it small. We've all seen open source
models. Um I hate the term open source.

4078
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:10,400
models. Um I hate the term open source.
 

4079
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,149
models. Um I hate the term open source.
Let me call them open weights or let me

4080
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:12,159
Let me call them open weights or let me
 

4081
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,070
Let me call them open weights or let me
call them self-hostable

4082
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:14,080
call them self-hostable
 

4083
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,149
call them self-hostable
uh models are becoming they're exploding

4084
01:15:16,149 --> 01:15:16,159
uh models are becoming they're exploding
 

4085
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,630
uh models are becoming they're exploding
onto the landscape. Um I read an article

4086
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:18,640
onto the landscape. Um I read an article
 

4087
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,110
onto the landscape. Um I read an article
recently about Y Combinator that 80% of

4088
01:15:21,110 --> 01:15:21,120
recently about Y Combinator that 80% of
 

4089
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,350
recently about Y Combinator that 80% of
the companies in Y Combinator we're

4090
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:23,360
the companies in Y Combinator we're
 

4091
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:25,350
the companies in Y Combinator we're
using small models from China in

4092
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:25,360
using small models from China in
 

4093
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,630
using small models from China in
particular. Um so the Chinese models um

4094
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:28,640
particular. Um so the Chinese models um
 

4095
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,630
particular. Um so the Chinese models um
in particular are doing really well

4096
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:30,640
in particular are doing really well
 

4097
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,910
in particular are doing really well
probably because of the overall

4098
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:31,920
probably because of the overall
 

4099
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,669
probably because of the overall
landscape there not leaning into the

4100
01:15:33,669 --> 01:15:33,679
landscape there not leaning into the
 

4101
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,270
landscape there not leaning into the
large models the same way as the west

4102
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:35,280
large models the same way as the west
 

4103
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,910
large models the same way as the west
is. Um I see that bifurcation happening.

4104
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:37,920
is. Um I see that bifurcation happening.
 

4105
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,590
is. Um I see that bifurcation happening.
China I think has that head start on the

4106
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:39,600
China I think has that head start on the
 

4107
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,910
China I think has that head start on the
smaller models that may last it may not

4108
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:41,920
smaller models that may last it may not
 

4109
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:44,070
smaller models that may last it may not
does I don't know. Uh but the point is

4110
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:44,080
does I don't know. Uh but the point is
 

4111
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:45,350
does I don't know. Uh but the point is
we're heading in that particular

4112
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:45,360
we're heading in that particular
 

4113
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,110
we're heading in that particular
direction of I'm going to call them

4114
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:47,120
direction of I'm going to call them
 

4115
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,350
direction of I'm going to call them

Uh, so the ability to take an open

4140
01:16:20,630 --> 01:16:20,640
Uh, so the ability to take an open
 

4141
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,030
Uh, so the ability to take an open
source model and fine-tune it for

4142
01:16:23,030 --> 01:16:23,040
source model and fine-tune it for
 

4143
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,669
source model and fine-tune it for
particular downstream tasks. Let me give

4144
01:16:25,669 --> 01:16:25,679
particular downstream tasks. Let me give
 

4145
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,430
particular downstream tasks. Let me give
one concrete example of that that I've

4146
01:16:27,430 --> 01:16:27,440
one concrete example of that that I've
 

4147
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:29,669
one concrete example of that that I've
personally experienced. I work a lot in

4148
01:16:29,669 --> 01:16:29,679
personally experienced. I work a lot in
 

4149
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:31,430
personally experienced. I work a lot in
Hollywood and I've worked a lot with

4150
01:16:31,430 --> 01:16:31,440
Hollywood and I've worked a lot with
 

4151
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,870
Hollywood and I've worked a lot with
studios making movies and um, one studio

4152
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:34,880
studios making movies and um, one studio
 

4153
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,470
studios making movies and um, one studio
in particular I was lucky enough to sell

4154
01:16:36,470 --> 01:16:36,480
in particular I was lucky enough to sell
 

4155
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,750
in particular I was lucky enough to sell
a movie to. It's still in

4156
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:37,760
a movie to. It's still in
 

4157
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,350
a movie to. It's still in
pre-production. It'll probably be in

4158
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:39,360
pre-production. It'll probably be in
 

4159
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,470
pre-production. It'll probably be in
pre-production forever. Um, but one of

4160
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:42,480
pre-production forever. Um, but one of
 

4161
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:43,990
pre-production forever. Um, but one of
the things I learned as part of that

4162
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:44,000
the things I learned as part of that
 

4163
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,070
the things I learned as part of that
process was IP in studios is so

4164
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:48,080
process was IP in studios is so
 

4165
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,270
process was IP in studios is so
protected, it's not even funny. Um, go

4166
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:51,280
protected, it's not even funny. Um, go
 

4167
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,350
protected, it's not even funny. Um, go

Avatar. Um the level of IP protection in

4182
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,400
Avatar. Um the level of IP protection in
 

4183
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,270
Avatar. Um the level of IP protection in
Hollywood is insane. The opportunity

4184
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:11,280
Hollywood is insane. The opportunity
 

4185
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,669
Hollywood is insane. The opportunity
with large language models is equally

4186
01:17:13,669 --> 01:17:13,679
with large language models is equally
 

4187
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,390
with large language models is equally
insane. Um a lot of the focus is on

4188
01:17:16,390 --> 01:17:16,400
insane. Um a lot of the focus is on
 

4189
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,229
insane. Um a lot of the focus is on
large language models for creation, for

4190
01:17:18,229 --> 01:17:18,239
large language models for creation, for
 

4191
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:19,669
large language models for creation, for
storytelling, for rendering and all

4192
01:17:19,669 --> 01:17:19,679
storytelling, for rendering and all
 

4193
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:21,510
storytelling, for rendering and all
that. But actually the major opportunity

4194
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:21,520
that. But actually the major opportunity
 

4195
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,229
that. But actually the major opportunity
that they have is actually for analysis.

4196
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:24,239
that they have is actually for analysis.
 

4197
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,950
that they have is actually for analysis.
Um to take a look at um synopsies of

4198
01:17:26,950 --> 01:17:26,960
Um to take a look at um synopsies of
 

4199
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,709
Um to take a look at um synopsies of
movies and find out what works and what

movies and find out what works and what
 

4201
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:30,950
movies and find out what works and what
doesn't. Why was this movie a hit and

doesn't. Why was this movie a hit and
 

4203
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,430
doesn't. Why was this movie a hit and
this one wasn't? What time of year was

4204
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:33,440
this one wasn't? What time of year was
 

4205

that kind of analysis is huge. But in

4212
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:41,440
that kind of analysis is huge. But in
 

4213
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:43,030
that kind of analysis is huge. But in
order to do that kind of analysis, you

4214
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:43,040
order to do that kind of analysis, you
 

4215
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,310
order to do that kind of analysis, you
need to share the details of your movie

4216
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:44,320
need to share the details of your movie

and they are getting smarter and
 

4231
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,790
and they are getting smarter and
smarter. the 7B uh model of today is as

4232
01:18:00,790 --> 01:18:00,800
smarter. the 7B uh model of today is as
 

4233
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,430
smarter. the 7B uh model of today is as
smart as the 50B model of yesterday. You

4234
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:03,440
smart as the 50B model of yesterday. You
 

4235
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,590
smart as the 50B model of yesterday. You
know, a year from now, the 7B model of a

4236
01:18:05,590 --> 01:18:05,600
know, a year from now, the 7B model of a
 

4237
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,030
know, a year from now, the 7B model of a
year from now will be as smart as the

01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:10,709
year from now will be as smart as the
300B uh model of yesterday year. Um so

4240
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:10,719
300B uh model of yesterday year. Um so
 

4241
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,790
300B uh model of yesterday year. Um so
they're moving in that direction of

4242
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:12,800
they're moving in that direction of
 

4243
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,750
they're moving in that direction of
building using small self-hosted models

4244
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:15,760
building using small self-hosted models
 

4245
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,110
building using small self-hosted models
which they can then fine-tune on

4246
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:17,120
which they can then fine-tune on
 

4247
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,030
which they can then fine-tune on
downstream tasks. Similar with other

4248
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:19,040
downstream tasks. Similar with other
 

4249
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:20,550

things where privacy is important, law

4250
01:18:20,550 --> 01:18:20,560

offices, medical offices, all of those
 

4253
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:24,229
offices, medical offices, all of those
kind of things. So those type of skills

4254
01:18:24,229 --> 01:18:24,239
kind of things. So those type of skills
 

4255
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:25,990
kind of things. So those type of skills
are fundamentally important going

4256
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:26,000
are fundamentally important going
 

4257
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,630
are fundamentally important going
forward. Um, so that's the bifurcation

4258
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:28,640
forward. Um, so that's the bifurcation
 

4259
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,790
forward. Um, so that's the bifurcation
that I'm seeing happening in AI. The

4260
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:30,800
that I'm seeing happening in AI. The
 

4261
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,870
that I'm seeing happening in AI. The
sooner bubble, I think is in the bigger

01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,390

01:18:35,910 --> 01:18:35,920
The later bubble is in the smaller
 

4267
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,470
The later bubble is in the smaller
self-hosted. But either way, for you for

4268
01:18:38,470 --> 01:18:38,480
self-hosted. But either way, for you for
 

4269
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,510

>> Quick questions.

4306
01:19:20,229 --> 01:19:20,239

 

4307
01:19:20,239 --> 01:19:23,750

I have heard a lot about how

4308
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:23,760
I have heard a lot about how
 

4309
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,910
I have heard a lot about how
and they're very like specific about

4310
01:19:25,910 --> 01:19:25,920
and they're very like specific about
 

4311
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:27,669
and they're very like specific about
like they want people who are like very

4312
01:19:27,669 --> 01:19:27,679
like they want people who are like very
 

4313
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:30,630
like they want people who are like very
specific about a problem that they have.

4314
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:30,640
specific about a problem that they have.
 

4315
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:33,030
specific about a problem that they have.
So they require people to be like

4316
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:33,040
So they require people to be like
 

4317
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,910
So they require people to be like
basically put on that one.

4318
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:35,920
basically put on that one.
 

4319
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:37,590
basically put on that one.
So

4320
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:37,600
So
 

4321
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,830
So
how do you think how how is it more

4322
01:19:39,830 --> 01:19:39,840
how do you think how how is it more
 

4323
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,070
how do you think how how is it more
important to

4324
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:42,080
important to
 

4325
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,709
important to
like diversify skills versus like

4326
01:19:44,709 --> 01:19:44,719
like diversify skills versus like
 

4327
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:46,390
like diversify skills versus like
actually like focusing on for example

4328
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:46,400
actually like focusing on for example

01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,630
LLM versus like computer vision or like
very specific

4332
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:52,640
very specific
 

4333
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,229
very specific
Right. So I mean I think so the question

4334
01:19:54,229 --> 01:19:54,239
Right. So I mean I think so the question
 

4335
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:55,990
Right. So I mean I think so the question
was around Nvidia in particular are

4336
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:56,000
was around Nvidia in particular are
 

4337
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,149
was around Nvidia in particular are
hiring for a very specific very narrow

4338
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:58,159
hiring for a very specific very narrow
 

4339
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,149
hiring for a very specific very narrow
scenario. So then the question is how

4340
01:20:00,149 --> 01:20:00,159
scenario. So then the question is how
 

4341
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:01,430
scenario. So then the question is how
important is it for you to become an

4342
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:01,440
important is it for you to become an
 

4343
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,030
important is it for you to become an
expert in a narrow scenario versus

4344
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:03,040
expert in a narrow scenario versus
 

4345
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:05,350
expert in a narrow scenario versus
divers diversifying your skills. I would

4346
01:20:05,350 --> 01:20:05,360
divers diversifying your skills. I would
 

4347
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:06,790
divers diversifying your skills. I would
always argue it's still better to

4348
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:06,800
always argue it's still better to
 

4349
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,350
always argue it's still better to
diversify your skills. Um because that

4350
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:09,360
diversify your skills. Um because that
 

4351
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,189
diversify your skills. Um because that
one narrow scenario is only that one

4352
01:20:11,189 --> 01:20:11,199
one narrow scenario is only that one
 

4353
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:12,550
one narrow scenario is only that one
narrow scenario and you're putting all

4354
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:12,560
narrow scenario and you're putting all
 

4355
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,310
narrow scenario and you're putting all
your eggs into one basket. Nvidia would

4356
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:14,320
your eggs into one basket. Nvidia would
 

4357
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,470
your eggs into one basket. Nvidia would
be a fantastic company to work for.

4358
01:20:16,470 --> 01:20:16,480
be a fantastic company to work for.
 

4359
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,550
be a fantastic company to work for.
Nothing against them in any way. But if

4360
01:20:18,550 --> 01:20:18,560
Nothing against them in any way. But if
 

4361
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,750
Nothing against them in any way. But if
you put all of your eggs into that

4362
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:19,760
you put all of your eggs into that
 

4363
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,390
you put all of your eggs into that
basket and you don't get it then what

4364
01:20:22,390 --> 01:20:22,400
basket and you don't get it then what
 

4365
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,229
basket and you don't get it then what
right? So I think the idea of really

4366
01:20:24,229 --> 01:20:24,239
right? So I think the idea of really
 

4367
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:26,310
right? So I think the idea of really
being able to

4368
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:26,320
being able to
 

4369
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,189
being able to
if you are [clears throat] passionate

4370
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:27,199
if you are [clears throat] passionate
 

4371
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,590
if you are [clears throat] passionate
about a thing to be very deep in that

4372
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:29,600
about a thing to be very deep in that
 

4373
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,550
about a thing to be very deep in that
thing is very very good but to only be

4374
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:32,560
thing is very very good but to only be
 

4375
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:34,709
thing is very very good but to only be
able to do that thing I think you know I

4376
01:20:34,709 --> 01:20:34,719
able to do that thing I think you know I
 

4377
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:36,790
able to do that thing I think you know I
would always encourage to be diversified

4378
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:36,800
would always encourage to be diversified
 

4379
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,390
would always encourage to be diversified
and when I say diversified like you were

4380
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:38,400
and when I say diversified like you were
 

4381
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,070
and when I say diversified like you were
saying LLMs or computer vision or

4382
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:40,080
saying LLMs or computer vision or
 

4383
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:41,590
saying LLMs or computer vision or
anything like that I think that mean

4384
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:41,600
anything like that I think that mean
 

4385
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:43,510
anything like that I think that mean
that's one part of it but it's like that

4386
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:43,520
that's one part of it but it's like that
 

4387
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,990
that's one part of it but it's like that
knowledge of models and how to use them

4388
01:20:45,990 --> 01:20:46,000
knowledge of models and how to use them
 

4389
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,470
knowledge of models and how to use them
to me is a uni skill. it the the

4390
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:48,480
to me is a uni skill. it the the
 

4391
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,470
to me is a uni skill. it the the
diversification of skills is breaking

4392
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:50,480
diversification of skills is breaking
 

4393
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:52,709
diversification of skills is breaking
outside of that also to be able to think

4394
01:20:52,709 --> 01:20:52,719
outside of that also to be able to think
 

4395
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:54,390
outside of that also to be able to think
okay what about building applications on

4396
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:54,400
okay what about building applications on
 

4397
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,390
okay what about building applications on
top of these what does scaling an

4398
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:56,400
top of these what does scaling an
 

4399
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,070
top of these what does scaling an
application look like what does software

4400
01:20:58,070 --> 01:20:58,080
application look like what does software
 

4401
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:59,830
application look like what does software
engineering in this case look like what

4402
01:20:59,830 --> 01:20:59,840
engineering in this case look like what
 

4403
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,830
engineering in this case look like what
about user experience and user

4404
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:01,840
about user experience and user
 

4405
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,750
about user experience and user
experience skills because it's all very

4406
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:03,760
experience skills because it's all very
 

4407
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,510
experience skills because it's all very
well to build a beautiful application

4408
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:05,520
well to build a beautiful application
 

4409
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,430
well to build a beautiful application
but if nobody can use it I'm looking at

4410
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:07,440
but if nobody can use it I'm looking at
 

4411
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,590
but if nobody can use it I'm looking at
you Microsoft office uh you know that

4412
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:09,600
you Microsoft office uh you know that
 

4413
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,270
you Microsoft office uh you know that
they you know there's like there's stuff

4414
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:11,280
they you know there's like there's stuff
 

4415
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,790
they you know there's like there's stuff
like that that you just you know that's

4416
01:21:12,790 --> 01:21:12,800
like that that you just you know that's
 

4417
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:14,390
like that that you just you know that's
what I really mean about diversifying

4418
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:14,400
what I really mean about diversifying
 

4419
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,630
what I really mean about diversifying
beyond so even in that like mono example

4420
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:16,640
beyond so even in that like mono example
 

4421
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,709
beyond so even in that like mono example
with Nvidia to be able to break out of

4422
01:21:18,709 --> 01:21:18,719
with Nvidia to be able to break out of
 

4423
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:20,790
with Nvidia to be able to break out of
like that one particular example, but to

4424
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:20,800
like that one particular example, but to
 

4425
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,709
like that one particular example, but to
show skills in other areas that are of

4426
01:21:22,709 --> 01:21:22,719
show skills in other areas that are of
 

4427
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:26,229
show skills in other areas that are of
value, I think is really important.

4428
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:26,239
value, I think is really important.
 

4429
01:21:26,239 --> 01:21:28,790
value, I think is really important.
Okay. Um, as we're just running a little

4430
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:28,800
Okay. Um, as we're just running a little
 

4431
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:31,110
Okay. Um, as we're just running a little
bit, so yeah, I just wanted to I've kind

4432
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:31,120
bit, so yeah, I just wanted to I've kind
 

4433
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,550
bit, so yeah, I just wanted to I've kind
of gone into it a little bit already,

4434
01:21:32,550 --> 01:21:32,560
of gone into it a little bit already,
 

4435
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,110
of gone into it a little bit already,
but I'm a massive advocate for small AI.

4436
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:35,120
but I'm a massive advocate for small AI.
 

4437
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,270
but I'm a massive advocate for small AI.
I really do believe small AI is the next

I really do believe small AI is the next
 

4439
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,430
I really do believe small AI is the next
big thing. Uh, because we're moving into

4440
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:39,440
big thing. Uh, because we're moving into
 

4441
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:40,950
big thing. Uh, because we're moving into

that I do at ARM, is we're kind of

4444
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:42,960
that I do at ARM, is we're kind of
 

4445
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,390
that I do at ARM, is we're kind of
moving into a world of like AI

everywhere all at once. Um, so there's a

4448
01:21:47,189 --> 01:21:47,199
everywhere all at once. Um, so there's a
 

4449
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:48,550
everywhere all at once. Um, so there's a
traditional, and it's interesting you

4450
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:48,560
traditional, and it's interesting you
 

4451
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,990
traditional, and it's interesting you
just brought up Nvidia because there's a

4452
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:50,000
just brought up Nvidia because there's a
 

4453
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,550
just brought up Nvidia because there's a
traditional conception that compute

4457
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:57,590

01:21:57,590 --> 01:21:57,600
to AI, but that's also changing, right?

01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:10,070
Photos or Apple Photos or something like
that. And that backend service runs the

4524
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,080
that. And that backend service runs the
 

4525
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,149
that. And that backend service runs the
model that you can search against it and

4526
01:23:12,149 --> 01:23:12,159
model that you can search against it and
 

4527
01:23:12,159 --> 01:23:14,470
model that you can search against it and
be able to do the assembly of them. What

4528
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:14,480
be able to do the assembly of them. What
 

4529
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,310
be able to do the assembly of them. What
Alipe wanted to do was like say there

4530
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:16,320
Alipe wanted to do was like say there
 

4531
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,390
Alipe wanted to do was like say there
are three problems with this. Problem

4532
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:18,400
are three problems with this. Problem
 

4533
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,310
are three problems with this. Problem
number one, privacy. You have to share

4534
01:23:20,310 --> 01:23:20,320
number one, privacy. You have to share
 

4535
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:22,390
number one, privacy. You have to share
your photos with a third party. Problem

4536
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:22,400
your photos with a third party. Problem
 

4537
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:24,390
your photos with a third party. Problem
number two, latency. You got to upload

4538
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:24,400
number two, latency. You got to upload
 

4539
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,310
number two, latency. You got to upload
those photos. You got to send the thing.

4540
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:26,320
those photos. You got to send the thing.
 

4541
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,830
those photos. You got to send the thing.
You got to have the backend do the

4542
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:27,840
You got to have the backend do the
 

4543
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,430
You got to have the backend do the
thing. And then you got to download the

4544
01:23:29,430 --> 01:23:29,440
thing. And then you got to download the
 

4545
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,110
thing. And then you got to download the
results from the thing. And then number

4546
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:31,120
results from the thing. And then number
 

4547
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:33,510
results from the thing. And then number
three is building that cloud service and

4548
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:33,520
three is building that cloud service and
 

4549
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,390
three is building that cloud service and
standing that up cost time and money. So

4550
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:36,400
standing that up cost time and money. So
 

4551
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,629
standing that up cost time and money. So
if they could move all of this onto the

4552
01:23:38,629 --> 01:23:38,639
if they could move all of this onto the
 

4553
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,950
if they could move all of this onto the
device itself, now the idea was they

4554
01:23:40,950 --> 01:23:40,960
device itself, now the idea was they
 

4555
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,550
device itself, now the idea was they
they could run a model on the device

4556
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:42,560
they could run a model on the device
 

4557
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:44,390
they could run a model on the device
that searches the photos on the device.

4558
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:44,400
that searches the photos on the device.
 

4559
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,709
that searches the photos on the device.
You don't have the latency and business

4560
01:23:46,709 --> 01:23:46,719
You don't have the latency and business
 

4561
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:48,470
You don't have the latency and business
perspective. They're now saving the

4562
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:48,480
perspective. They're now saving the
 

4563
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,470
perspective. They're now saving the
money on stand on creating this standup

4564
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:50,480
money on stand on creating this standup
 

4565
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,310
money on stand on creating this standup
service. They now have AI running on the

4566
01:23:52,310 --> 01:23:52,320
service. They now have AI running on the
 

4567
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,310
service. They now have AI running on the
CPU in order to be able to do that.

4568
01:23:54,310 --> 01:23:54,320
CPU in order to be able to do that.
 

4569
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,310
CPU in order to be able to do that.
Apple are also people who've invested

4570
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:56,320
Apple are also people who've invested
 

4571
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,310
Apple are also people who've invested
heavily in this scalable matrix

4572
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,320
heavily in this scalable matrix

extensions. You see whenever they talk

4574
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:00,320
extensions. You see whenever they talk
 

4575
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,629
extensions. You see whenever they talk
about if you've ever watched WWDC or

4576
01:24:02,629 --> 01:24:02,639
about if you've ever watched WWDC or
 

4577
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:04,310
about if you've ever watched WWDC or
anything like that when they talk about

4578
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:04,320
anything like that when they talk about
 

4579
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,790
anything like that when they talk about
the new A series chips and M series

4580
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:06,800
the new A series chips and M series
 

4581
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,709
the new A series chips and M series
chips about the neural cores and those

4582
01:24:08,709 --> 01:24:08,719
chips about the neural cores and those
 

4583
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:09,910
chips about the neural cores and those
kind of things in them that's part of

4584
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:09,920
kind of things in them that's part of
 

4585
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,310
kind of things in them that's part of
the idea. So to think about breaking

4586
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:12,320
the idea. So to think about breaking
 

4587
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,709
the idea. So to think about breaking
that you know habit that we've gotten

4588
01:24:14,709 --> 01:24:14,719
that you know habit that we've gotten
 

4589
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,790
that you know habit that we've gotten
into uh where you need a GPU to be able

4590
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:16,800
into uh where you need a GPU to be able
 

4591
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,110
into uh where you need a GPU to be able
to do AI is part of the trend that the

4592
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:19,120
to do AI is part of the trend that the
 

4593
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,030
to do AI is part of the trend that the
world is heading in. Apple are probably

4594
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:21,040
world is heading in. Apple are probably
 

4595
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,629
world is heading in. Apple are probably
one of the leaders in that. I'm very

4596
01:24:22,629 --> 01:24:22,639
one of the leaders in that. I'm very
 

4597
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:24,310
one of the leaders in that. I'm very
very bullish on Apple and Apple

4598
01:24:24,310 --> 01:24:24,320
very bullish on Apple and Apple
 

4599
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,910
very bullish on Apple and Apple
intelligence as a result and um from the

4600
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:27,920
intelligence as a result and um from the
 

4601
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:31,510
intelligence as a result and um from the
AI perspective and you know seeing that

4602
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:31,520
AI perspective and you know seeing that
 

4603
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,590
AI perspective and you know seeing that
trend and following that vector to its

4604
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:33,600
trend and following that vector to its
 

4605
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:36,310
trend and following that vector to its
logical conclusion we're as models are

4606
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:36,320
logical conclusion we're as models are
 

4607
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,550
logical conclusion we're as models are
getting smaller embedded intelligence

4608
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:38,560
getting smaller embedded intelligence
 

4609
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:40,950
getting smaller embedded intelligence
getting everywhere isn't a pipe dream it

4610
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:40,960
getting everywhere isn't a pipe dream it
 

4611
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,550
getting everywhere isn't a pipe dream it
isn't sci-fi anymore it's going to be a

4612
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:42,560
isn't sci-fi anymore it's going to be a
 

4613
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,070
isn't sci-fi anymore it's going to be a
reality that we'll be seeing very very

4614
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:44,080
reality that we'll be seeing very very
 

4615
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:46,790
reality that we'll be seeing very very
shortly so that idea of that convergence

4616
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:46,800
shortly so that idea of that convergence
 

4617
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,510
shortly so that idea of that convergence
of AI because of the ability of smaller

4618
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:49,520
of AI because of the ability of smaller
 

4619
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:52,070
of AI because of the ability of smaller
models getting smarter and lower powered

4620
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:52,080
models getting smarter and lower powered
 

4621
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:54,149
models getting smarter and lower powered
devices being able to run them. We see

4622
01:24:54,149 --> 01:24:54,159
devices being able to run them. We see
 

4623
01:24:54,159 --> 01:24:55,590
devices being able to run them. We see
that convergence hitting and I see

4624
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:55,600
that convergence hitting and I see
 

4625
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,550
that convergence hitting and I see
massive opportunity there.

4626
01:24:58,550 --> 01:24:58,560
massive opportunity there.
 

4627
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:00,709
massive opportunity there.
So um one last part and just going back

4628
01:25:00,709 --> 01:25:00,719
So um one last part and just going back
 

4629
01:25:00,719 --> 01:25:02,629
So um one last part and just going back
to agents for a moment. I think you know

4630
01:25:02,629 --> 01:25:02,639
to agents for a moment. I think you know
 

4631
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,550
to agents for a moment. I think you know
the one thing that I always say is like

4632
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:04,560
the one thing that I always say is like
 

4633
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:06,790
the one thing that I always say is like
a hidden part of artificial intelligence

4634
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800
a hidden part of artificial intelligence
 

4635
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,629
a hidden part of artificial intelligence
is really what I like to call artificial

4636
01:25:08,629 --> 01:25:08,639
is really what I like to call artificial
 

4637
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:10,390
is really what I like to call artificial
understanding. And when you can start

4638
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:10,400
understanding. And when you can start
 

4639
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,950
understanding. And when you can start
using models to understand things on

4640
01:25:12,950 --> 01:25:12,960
using models to understand things on
 

4641
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:15,270
using models to understand things on
your behalf and when they understand

4642
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:15,280
your behalf and when they understand
 

4643
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:17,830
your behalf and when they understand
them on your behalf to be able to craft

4644
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:17,840
them on your behalf to be able to craft
 

4645
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,629
them on your behalf to be able to craft
from that understanding new things you

4646
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:20,639
from that understanding new things you
 

4647
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,470
from that understanding new things you
can actually develop superpowers where

4648
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:22,480
can actually develop superpowers where
 

4649
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,750
can actually develop superpowers where
you're far more effective than ever

4650
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:23,760
you're far more effective than ever
 

4651
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:25,590
you're far more effective than ever
before. Be that creating code or

4652
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:25,600
before. Be that creating code or
 

4653
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,270
before. Be that creating code or
creating other things. And I'm going to

4654
01:25:27,270 --> 01:25:27,280
creating other things. And I'm going to
 

4655
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,189
creating other things. And I'm going to
give one quick demo just so we can wrap

4656
01:25:29,189 --> 01:25:29,199
give one quick demo just so we can wrap
 

4657
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:32,310
give one quick demo just so we can wrap
up. Um, and I was talking earlier about

4658
01:25:32,310 --> 01:25:32,320
up. Um, and I was talking earlier about
 

4659
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:35,590
up. Um, and I was talking earlier about
generating video.

4660
01:25:35,590 --> 01:25:35,600
generating video.
 

4661
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:42,229
generating video.
So, uh, this picture is Whoops.

4662
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:42,239

 

4663
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:44,709

Sorry, the connection here is not very

4664
01:25:44,709 --> 01:25:44,719
Sorry, the connection here is not very
 

4665
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:47,270
Sorry, the connection here is not very
good. I lost it. So, here we go. This

4666
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:47,280
good. I lost it. So, here we go. This
 

4667
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:49,030
good. I lost it. So, here we go. This
picture here is actually of my son

4668
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:49,040
picture here is actually of my son
 

4669
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,430
picture here is actually of my son
playing ice hockey. And I took this

4670
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:51,440
playing ice hockey. And I took this
 

4671
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:54,870
playing ice hockey. And I took this
picture and I was saying, "Okay, I think

4672
01:25:54,870 --> 01:25:54,880
picture and I was saying, "Okay, I think
 

4673
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:58,149
picture and I was saying, "Okay, I think
I'm very good at prompting." And I wrote

4674
01:25:58,149 --> 01:25:58,159
I'm very good at prompting." And I wrote
 

4675
01:25:58,159 --> 01:26:00,149
I'm very good at prompting." And I wrote
a nice prompt for this picture to get

4676
01:26:00,149 --> 01:26:00,159
a nice prompt for this picture to get
 

4677
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:01,590
a nice prompt for this picture to get
him. He's in the middle of taking a

4678
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:01,600
him. He's in the middle of taking a

4681
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,510
slapshot. He's got some beautiful flex
on his stick. And I asked it like,

4682
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:05,520
on his stick. And I asked it like,
 

4683
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,350
on his stick. And I asked it like,
"Okay, it's a prompt like you know him

4684
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:07,360
"Okay, it's a prompt like you know him
 

4685

scoring a goal. What do you think
 

4687
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,629
scoring a goal. What do you think
happened?

4688
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:10,639
happened?
 

4689
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:13,270
happened?
Should we Should we watch? Let's see if

Should we Should we watch? Let's see if
 

4691
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:21,189
Should we Should we watch? Let's see if
it works.

4692
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:21,199

 

4693
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:22,709

Ah, this was the wrong video, but it

4694
01:26:22,709 --> 01:26:22,719
Ah, this was the wrong video, but it
 

4695
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:25,750
Ah, this was the wrong video, but it
still shows the same idea. Um, because

4696
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:25,760
still shows the same idea. Um, because
 

4697
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,709
still shows the same idea. Um, because
of poor prompting or because of poor

about it in aic senses, the arena that

4702
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:34,880
about it in aic senses, the arena that
 

4703
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,870
about it in aic senses, the arena that
he was in, which is a practice arena and

4704
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:36,880
he was in, which is a practice arena and
 

4705
01:26:36,880 --> 01:26:39,110

pause it. Um,
 

4709
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,750
pause it. Um,
if I just rewind to here,

4710
01:26:45,750 --> 01:26:45,760
if I just rewind to here,
 

4711
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,990
if I just rewind to here,
and if we look up in this top right hand

4712
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:48,000
and if we look up in this top right hand
 

4713
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,590
and if we look up in this top right hand
corner here, this is basically where

4714
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:49,600
corner here, this is basically where
 

4715
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,149
corner here, this is basically where
they store all the garbage. Um, but the

4716
01:26:52,149 --> 01:26:52,159
they store all the garbage. Um, but the
 

4717
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,990

4718
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:54,000
AI didn't know that, had no idea of it,
 

4719
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,590
AI didn't know that, had no idea of it,
so assumed it was a full arena and it

4720
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:55,600
so assumed it was a full arena and it
 

4721
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,910
so assumed it was a full arena and it
started painting people in. And even

4722
01:26:57,910 --> 01:26:57,920
started painting people in. And even
 

4723
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:00,070
started painting people in. And even

cheers and somehow he has two sticks in

4726
01:27:02,709 --> 01:27:02,719
cheers and somehow he has two sticks in
 

4727
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,470
cheers and somehow he has two sticks in
his hand instead of one and they forgot

4728
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:04,480
his hand instead of one and they forgot
 

4729
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:07,430
his hand instead of one and they forgot
his name. Right? So, I did not go

4730
01:27:07,430 --> 01:27:07,440
his name. Right? So, I did not go
 

4731
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,669
his name. Right? So, I did not go
through an agentic workflow to do this.

4732
01:27:09,669 --> 01:27:09,679
through an agentic workflow to do this.

um that is working on movie creation
using AI and I want to show you a little

4754
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:35,520
using AI and I want to show you a little
 

4755
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,510
using AI and I want to show you a little
sample here of a movie that been working

like if you want to have performances

4760
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:41,280
like if you want to have performances
 

4761
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,590
like if you want to have performances
out of virtual actors and actresses, you

4762
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:43,600
out of virtual actors and actresses, you
 

4763
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,590
out of virtual actors and actresses, you
need to have emotion, right? You need to

4764
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:45,600
need to have emotion, right? You need to
 

4765
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,830
need to have emotion, right? You need to
be able to convey that emotion and you

4766
01:27:47,830 --> 01:27:47,840
be able to convey that emotion and you
 

4767
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:49,910
be able to convey that emotion and you
also need to be able to put that emotion

4768
01:27:49,910 --> 01:27:49,920
also need to be able to put that emotion
 

4769
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:52,229
also need to be able to put that emotion
in the context of the entire story

4770
01:27:52,229 --> 01:27:52,239
in the context of the entire story
 

4771
01:27:52,239 --> 01:27:54,310
in the context of the entire story
because when you create a video from a

4772
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:54,320
because when you create a video from a
 

4773
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:55,910
because when you create a video from a
prompt, you're creating an 8-second

4774
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:55,920
prompt, you're creating an 8-second
 

4775
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:58,310
prompt, you're creating an 8-second
snippet. That 8-second snippet needs to

4776
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:58,320
snippet. That 8-second snippet needs to
 

4777
01:27:58,320 --> 01:27:59,669
snippet. That 8-second snippet needs to
know what's going on in the rest of the

4778
01:27:59,669 --> 01:27:59,679
know what's going on in the rest of the
 

4779
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:03,110
know what's going on in the rest of the
story, right? So, if I show this one for

4780
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:03,120
story, right? So, if I show this one for
 

4781
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:05,830
story, right? So, if I show this one for
a moment, and it's a little wooden at

4782
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:05,840
a moment, and it's a little wooden at
 

4783
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,590
a moment, and it's a little wooden at
the moment. It's not really working

4784
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:07,600
the moment. It's not really working
 

4785
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:10,149
the moment. It's not really working
perfectly. I have professional actors

4786
01:28:10,149 --> 01:28:10,159
perfectly. I have professional actors
 

4787
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:11,669
perfectly. I have professional actors
who are friends who are advising me on

4788
01:28:11,669 --> 01:28:11,679
who are friends who are advising me on
 

4789
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:12,709
who are friends who are advising me on
this and they laughed at the

4790
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:12,719
this and they laughed at the
 

4791
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:15,990
this and they laughed at the
performances. But try to view it through

4792
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:16,000
performances. But try to view it through
 

4793
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,830
performances. But try to view it through
the difference that we had from an

4794
01:28:17,830 --> 01:28:17,840
the difference that we had from an
 

4795
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:19,830
the difference that we had from an
unagentic prompt with the hockey player

4796
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:19,840
unagentic prompt with the hockey player
 

4797
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:22,550
unagentic prompt with the hockey player
to this one.

4798
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:22,560
to this one.
 

4799
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:34,070
to this one.
Let's hopefully we can hear it.

4800
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:34,080

 

4801
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:40,550

I guess I can do the pub quiz after all.

4802
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:40,560

 

4803
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:46,070

They just shut me down. I'm so close.

4804
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,080
They just shut me down. I'm so close.
 

4805
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,709
They just shut me down. I'm so close.
But they wouldn't listen.

4806
01:28:48,709 --> 01:28:48,719
But they wouldn't listen.
 

4807
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:49,270
But they wouldn't listen.
>> I won't.

4808
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:49,280
>> I won't.
 

4809
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,350
>> I won't.
>> They never listen.

4810
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:51,360
>> They never listen.
 

4811
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,470
>> They never listen.
So like here's the idea of like again

4812
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:54,480
So like here's the idea of like again
 

4813
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,470
So like here's the idea of like again
just thinking in terms of agentic as I

4814
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:56,480
just thinking in terms of agentic as I
 

4815
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,750
just thinking in terms of agentic as I
was saying earlier on breaking it into

4816
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:57,760
was saying earlier on breaking it into
 

4817
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,750
was saying earlier on breaking it into
those steps that allowed me to use

4818
01:28:59,750 --> 01:28:59,760
those steps that allowed me to use
 

4819
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,750
those steps that allowed me to use
exactly the same engine as I was showing

4820
01:29:01,750 --> 01:29:01,760
exactly the same engine as I was showing
 

4821
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:04,310
exactly the same engine as I was showing
you earlier on that fails to be able to

4822
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:04,320
you earlier on that fails to be able to
 

4823
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,149
you earlier on that fails to be able to
show something that works and is able to

4824
01:29:06,149 --> 01:29:06,159
show something that works and is able to
 

4825
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:07,189
show something that works and is able to
do [music] things like portraying

4826
01:29:07,189 --> 01:29:07,199
do [music] things like portraying
 

4827
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:10,149
do [music] things like portraying
emotion that I just spoke about. So I

4828
01:29:10,149 --> 01:29:10,159
emotion that I just spoke about. So I
 

4829
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:11,669
emotion that I just spoke about. So I
know we're a little bit over time so

4830
01:29:11,669 --> 01:29:11,679
know we're a little bit over time so
 

4831
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,270
know we're a little bit over time so
sorry about that. I can take any

4832
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:13,280
sorry about that. I can take any
 

4833
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,950
sorry about that. I can take any
questions if anybody has any. I see

4834
01:29:14,950 --> 01:29:14,960
questions if anybody has any. I see
 

4835
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:16,390
questions if anybody has any. I see
Andrew is here as well. He's at the

4836
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:16,400
Andrew is here as well. He's at the
 

4837
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,149
Andrew is here as well. He's at the
back. And I just really want to say

4838
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:18,159
back. And I just really want to say
 

4839
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:19,669
back. And I just really want to say
thank you so much for your attention. I

4840
01:29:19,669 --> 01:29:19,679
thank you so much for your attention. I
 

4841
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:22,536
thank you so much for your attention. I
really appreciate it.

4842
01:29:22,536 --> 01:29:22,546
really appreciate it.
 

4843
01:29:22,546 --> 01:29:29,030
really appreciate it.
[applause]

4844
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,040

 

4845
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:53,350

>> Yep.

4846
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:53,360

 

4847
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,030

Y.

4848
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:55,040
Y.
 

4849
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:56,390
Y.
>> It's a great question. Just to repeat

4850
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:56,400
>> It's a great question. Just to repeat
 

4851
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,669
>> It's a great question. Just to repeat
for the video, how much of the

4852
01:29:57,669 --> 01:29:57,679
for the video, how much of the
 

4853
01:29:57,679 --> 01:29:59,030
for the video, how much of the
improvement is from the use of an

4854
01:29:59,030 --> 01:29:59,040
improvement is from the use of an
 

4855
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:02,149
improvement is from the use of an
agentic workflow versus just lack of

4856
01:30:02,149 --> 01:30:02,159
agentic workflow versus just lack of
 

4857
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:03,750
agentic workflow versus just lack of
hockey stuff in the training set for the

4858
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:03,760
hockey stuff in the training set for the
 

4859
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:07,189
hockey stuff in the training set for the
failed one? Um, I not comparing like to

4860
01:30:07,189 --> 01:30:07,199
failed one? Um, I not comparing like to
 

4861
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:09,990
failed one? Um, I not comparing like to
likes, so just using my gut. Um, when I

4862
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:10,000
likes, so just using my gut. Um, when I
 

4863
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,750
likes, so just using my gut. Um, when I
looked at when I broke this down into

4864
01:30:11,750 --> 01:30:11,760
looked at when I broke this down into
 

4865
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,830
looked at when I broke this down into
the workflow that said, "Okay, I created

4866
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:13,840
the workflow that said, "Okay, I created
 

4867
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:16,070
the workflow that said, "Okay, I created
scenes like this one and they were awful

4868
01:30:16,070 --> 01:30:16,080
scenes like this one and they were awful
 

4869
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,629
scenes like this one and they were awful
when I just did it directly for myself

4870
01:30:18,629 --> 01:30:18,639
when I just did it directly for myself
 

4871
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:21,189
when I just did it directly for myself
um with no basis, no agentic, no

4872
01:30:21,189 --> 01:30:21,199
um with no basis, no agentic, no
 

4873
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:23,590
um with no basis, no agentic, no
artificial understanding." And when I

4874
01:30:23,590 --> 01:30:23,600
artificial understanding." And when I
 

4875
01:30:23,600 --> 01:30:25,189
artificial understanding." And when I
broke it down into the steps where it's

4876
01:30:25,189 --> 01:30:25,199
broke it down into the steps where it's
 

4877
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:27,590
broke it down into the steps where it's
like, okay, in this scene the girl is

4878
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:27,600
like, okay, in this scene the girl is
 

4879
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,390
like, okay, in this scene the girl is
sitting on the bench and she's upset and

4880
01:30:30,390 --> 01:30:30,400
sitting on the bench and she's upset and
 

4881
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:31,990
sitting on the bench and she's upset and
the person is talking to her and he

4882
01:30:31,990 --> 01:30:32,000
the person is talking to her and he
 

4883
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,790
the person is talking to her and he
wants to comfort her. um feeding that to

4884
01:30:36,790 --> 01:30:36,800
wants to comfort her. um feeding that to
 

4885
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:39,030
wants to comfort her. um feeding that to
a large language model along with the

4886
01:30:39,030 --> 01:30:39,040
a large language model along with the
 

4887
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:41,189
a large language model along with the
entire story and along with the

4888
01:30:41,189 --> 01:30:41,199
entire story and along with the
 

4889
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:43,110
entire story and along with the
constraints that I had where the shot

4890
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:43,120
constraints that I had where the shot
 

4891
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,510
constraints that I had where the shot
has to be 8 seconds long, clear dialogue

4892
01:30:45,510 --> 01:30:45,520
has to be 8 seconds long, clear dialogue
 

4893
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,430
has to be 8 seconds long, clear dialogue
and all of those kind of thing. And then

4894
01:30:47,430 --> 01:30:47,440
and all of those kind of thing. And then
 

4895
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:50,870
and all of those kind of thing. And then
to understand my intent from that one,

4896
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:50,880
to understand my intent from that one,
 

4897
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,590
to understand my intent from that one,
the LLM ended up expressing a prompt

4898
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:53,600
the LLM ended up expressing a prompt
 

4899
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,470
the LLM ended up expressing a prompt
that was far more loquacious than I ever

4900
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:56,480
that was far more loquacious than I ever
 

4901
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,990
that was far more loquacious than I ever
would have, that was far more

4902
01:30:57,990 --> 01:30:58,000
would have, that was far more
 

4903
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,990
would have, that was far more
descriptive than I ever would have. The

4904
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:00,000
descriptive than I ever would have. The
 

4905
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,390
descriptive than I ever would have. The
LLM had understanding of what makes a

4906
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:02,400
LLM had understanding of what makes a
 

4907
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:04,070
LLM had understanding of what makes a
good shot, what makes a good angle, what

4908
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:04,080
good shot, what makes a good angle, what
 

4909
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,390
good shot, what makes a good angle, what
makes good emotion far more than I would

4910
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:06,400
makes good emotion far more than I would
 

4911
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,990
makes good emotion far more than I would
have I could spend hours trying to

4912
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:08,000
have I could spend hours trying to
 

4913
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,149
have I could spend hours trying to
describe it. So that first step in the

4914
01:31:10,149 --> 01:31:10,159
describe it. So that first step in the
 

4915
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:12,310
describe it. So that first step in the
agentic flow of it doing that for me and

4916
01:31:12,310 --> 01:31:12,320
agentic flow of it doing that for me and
 

4917
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:15,110
agentic flow of it doing that for me and
understanding my intent was huge. The

4918
01:31:15,110 --> 01:31:15,120
understanding my intent was huge. The
 

4919
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:16,870
understanding my intent was huge. The
second step then is I you know the tools

4920
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:16,880
second step then is I you know the tools
 

4921
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:18,790
second step then is I you know the tools
that it's going to use. So I explicitly

4922
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:18,800
that it's going to use. So I explicitly
 

4923
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:20,390
that it's going to use. So I explicitly
said which video engine I'm going to be

4924
01:31:20,390 --> 01:31:20,400
said which video engine I'm going to be
 

4925
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,470
said which video engine I'm going to be
using. I was using Gemini as the LLM and

4926
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:22,480
using. I was using Gemini as the LLM and
 

4927
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,390
using. I was using Gemini as the LLM and
hopefully Gemini is familiar with VO you

4928
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:24,400
hopefully Gemini is familiar with VO you
 

4929
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,510
hopefully Gemini is familiar with VO you
know that kind of stuff. So to

4930
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:25,520
know that kind of stuff. So to
 

4931
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:27,270
know that kind of stuff. So to
understand the idiosyncrasies of doing

4932
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:27,280
understand the idiosyncrasies of doing
 

4933
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,430
understand the idiosyncrasies of doing
things with VO what I learned like for

4934
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:29,440
things with VO what I learned like for
 

4935
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,830
things with VO what I learned like for
example VO is very bad at doing high

4936
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:31,840
example VO is very bad at doing high
 

4937
01:31:31,840 --> 01:31:34,470
example VO is very bad at doing high
action scenes but is very good at doing

4938
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:34,480
action scenes but is very good at doing
 

4939
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:37,270
action scenes but is very good at doing
slow camera polls to do emotion as you

4940
01:31:37,270 --> 01:31:37,280
slow camera polls to do emotion as you
 

4941
01:31:37,280 --> 01:31:39,590
slow camera polls to do emotion as you
saw in this case. So the LLM knew that

4942
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:39,600
saw in this case. So the LLM knew that
 

4943
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,350
saw in this case. So the LLM knew that
from me declaring I was using that as a

4944
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:41,360
from me declaring I was using that as a
 

4945
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,510
from me declaring I was using that as a
tool and then further it built a prompt

4946
01:31:43,510 --> 01:31:43,520
tool and then further it built a prompt
 

4947
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,189
tool and then further it built a prompt
and then further refined the prompt from

4948
01:31:45,189 --> 01:31:45,199
and then further refined the prompt from
 

4949
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:47,430
and then further refined the prompt from
that and then the third part actually

4950
01:31:47,430 --> 01:31:47,440
that and then the third part actually
 

4951
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,030
that and then the third part actually
using the tool to actually generate it

4952
01:31:49,030 --> 01:31:49,040
using the tool to actually generate it
 

4953
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:51,030
using the tool to actually generate it
for me. Generating a video with

4954
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:51,040
for me. Generating a video with
 

4955
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,870
for me. Generating a video with
something like VO costs I think between

4956
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:52,880
something like VO costs I think between
 

4957
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,709
something like VO costs I think between
two and three dollars to generate like

4958
01:31:54,709 --> 01:31:54,719
two and three dollars to generate like
 

4959
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:56,790
two and three dollars to generate like
four videos in credits. So the last

4960
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:56,800
four videos in credits. So the last
 

4961
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,149
four videos in credits. So the last
thing I want to do is generate lots and

4962
01:31:58,149 --> 01:31:58,159
thing I want to do is generate lots and
 

4963
01:31:58,159 --> 01:31:59,590
thing I want to do is generate lots and
lots and lots and lots of videos and

4964
01:31:59,590 --> 01:31:59,600
lots and lots and lots of videos and
 

4965
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,750
lots and lots and lots of videos and
throw good money after bad. But all of

4966
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:01,760
throw good money after bad. But all of
 

4967
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:04,470
throw good money after bad. But all of
that token spend that I did earlier on

4968
01:32:04,470 --> 01:32:04,480
that token spend that I did earlier on
 

4969
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,870
that token spend that I did earlier on
to understand my intent and then to make

4970
01:32:06,870 --> 01:32:06,880
to understand my intent and then to make
 

4971
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:09,030
to understand my intent and then to make
the plan for using the agent was saved

4972
01:32:09,030 --> 01:32:09,040
the plan for using the agent was saved
 

4973
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,870
the plan for using the agent was saved
in the back end where it got it right

4974
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:10,880
in the back end where it got it right
 

4975
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,709
in the back end where it got it right
like you know maybe not get it right

4976
01:32:12,709 --> 01:32:12,719
like you know maybe not get it right
 

4977
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:14,550
like you know maybe not get it right
first time but would very rarely take

4978
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:14,560
first time but would very rarely take
 

4979
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,149
first time but would very rarely take
more than two or three tries to get

4980
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:16,159
more than two or three tries to get
 

4981
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:17,990
more than two or three tries to get
something that was really really nice.

4982
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,000
something that was really really nice.
 

4983
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,149
something that was really really nice.
So I think you know without com

4984
01:32:20,149 --> 01:32:20,159
So I think you know without com
 

4985
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:22,550
So I think you know without com
comparing like with like I do think that

4986
01:32:22,550 --> 01:32:22,560
comparing like with like I do think that
 

4987
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:23,910
comparing like with like I do think that
plan of action and going through a

4988
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:23,920
plan of action and going through a
 

4989
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,510
plan of action and going through a
workflow like that worked very very

4990
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:25,520
workflow like that worked very very
 

4991
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,590
workflow like that worked very very

01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:43,990
>> What has surprised me the most about the
AI industry over the years? Oh, that's a

5002
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:44,000
AI industry over the years? Oh, that's a
 

5003
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,870
AI industry over the years? Oh, that's a
good one. Um, I think what has surprised

5004
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:46,880
good one. Um, I think what has surprised
 

5005
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,669
good one. Um, I think what has surprised
me the most, um, and it probably

5006
01:32:49,669 --> 01:32:49,679
me the most, um, and it probably
 

5007
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:51,830
me the most, um, and it probably
shouldn't have surprised me is how much

5008
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:51,840
shouldn't have surprised me is how much
 

5009
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,790
shouldn't have surprised me is how much
hype took over. Um, I actually I

5010
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:54,800
hype took over. Um, I actually I
 

5011
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,110
hype took over. Um, I actually I
honestly thought a lot of people who are

5012
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:57,120
honestly thought a lot of people who are
 

5013
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,030
honestly thought a lot of people who are
in important decision-making roles and

5014
01:32:59,030 --> 01:32:59,040
in important decision-making roles and
 

5015
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,030
in important decision-making roles and
that kind of thing would be able to see

5016
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:01,040
that kind of thing would be able to see
 

5017
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:04,149
that kind of thing would be able to see
the signal better than they did. Um and

5018
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:04,159
the signal better than they did. Um and
 

5019
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:06,790
the signal better than they did. Um and
I think the other part was that the um

5020
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:06,800
I think the other part was that the um
 

5021
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,950
I think the other part was that the um
the desire to make immediate profits as

the desire to make immediate profits as
 

5023
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,590
the desire to make immediate profits as
opposed to long-term gains also

opposed to long-term gains also
 

5025
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,669
opposed to long-term gains also
surprised me a lot. Um let me share one

5026
01:33:15,669 --> 01:33:15,679
surprised me a lot. Um let me share one
 

5027
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:18,709
surprised me a lot. Um let me share one
story um in that space was one of the

5028
01:33:18,709 --> 01:33:18,719
story um in that space was one of the
 

5029
01:33:18,719 --> 01:33:21,669
story um in that space was one of the
things that after we Andrew and I taught

5030
01:33:21,669 --> 01:33:21,679
things that after we Andrew and I taught
 

5031
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,430
things that after we Andrew and I taught
the TensorFlow specializations on

5032
01:33:23,430 --> 01:33:23,440
the TensorFlow specializations on
 

5033
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:26,550
the TensorFlow specializations on
Corsera and after that Google launched a

5034
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:26,560
Corsera and after that Google launched a
 

5035
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,790
Corsera and after that Google launched a
professional certificate where the idea

5036
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:28,800
professional certificate where the idea
 

5037
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:30,629
professional certificate where the idea
of this professional certificate was we'

5038
01:33:30,629 --> 01:33:30,639
of this professional certificate was we'
 

5039
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:32,790
of this professional certificate was we'
give a rigorous exam and at the end of

5040
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:32,800
give a rigorous exam and at the end of
 

5041
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,470
give a rigorous exam and at the end of
the rigorous exam if you got the

5042
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:34,480
the rigorous exam if you got the
 

5043
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:37,990
the rigorous exam if you got the
certificate um it was a high prestige

5044
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:38,000
certificate um it was a high prestige
 

5045
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,910
certificate um it was a high prestige

goodwill that came out of it was
 

5059
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,990
goodwill that came out of it was
immense. Um I can tell two story I'll

Syria over the last few years and he got
 

5073
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,270
Syria over the last few years and he got
the TensorFlow certificate. He was one

5074
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:15,280
the TensorFlow certificate. He was one
 

5075
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,350
the TensorFlow certificate. He was one
of the first in Syria to get it and it

5076

a major German firm and I but I met him
 

5083
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:26,310
a major German firm and I but I met him
at an event in Amsterdam where he told

5084
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:26,320
at an event in Amsterdam where he told
 

5085
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:29,830
at an event in Amsterdam where he told
me his story and now because of like the

5086

into a peaceful zone all because he got
 

5095
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:42,550

this like AI thing right and there were

5096
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:42,560
this like AI thing right and there were
 

5097
01:34:42,560 --> 01:34:45,189
this like AI thing right and there were
countless stories like that um very

5098
01:34:45,189 --> 01:34:45,199
countless stories like that um very
 

5099
01:34:45,199 --> 01:34:47,270
countless stories like that um very
inspirational, very beautiful stories.

5100
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:47,280
inspirational, very beautiful stories.
 

5101
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:49,030
inspirational, very beautiful stories.
But the thing that surprised me then was

5102
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:49,040
But the thing that surprised me then was
 

5103
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,870
But the thing that surprised me then was
uh sometimes the lack of investment in

5104
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:50,880
uh sometimes the lack of investment in
 

5105
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,950
uh sometimes the lack of investment in
that where there was no revenue being

5106
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:52,960
that where there was no revenue being
 

5107
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,390
that where there was no revenue being
generated for the company out of that.

5108
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:54,400
generated for the company out of that.
 

5109
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,950
generated for the company out of that.
We deliberately um kept it revenue

5110
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:56,960
We deliberately um kept it revenue
 

5111
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,870
We deliberately um kept it revenue
neutral so that the price of the exams

5112
01:34:58,870 --> 01:34:58,880
neutral so that the price of the exams
 

5113
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:00,870
neutral so that the price of the exams
could go down. We wanted it to self-

5114
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:00,880
could go down. We wanted it to self-
 

5115
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,870
could go down. We wanted it to self-
sustain. It ended up not being revenue

5116
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:02,880
sustain. It ended up not being revenue
 

5117
01:35:02,880 --> 01:35:04,229
sustain. It ended up not being revenue
neutral. It ended up costing the company

5118
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:04,239
neutral. It ended up costing the company
 

5119
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:07,189
neutral. It ended up costing the company
about 100,000 to 150,000 a year. So they

5120
01:35:07,189 --> 01:35:07,199
about 100,000 to 150,000 a year. So they
 

5121
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:09,430
about 100,000 to 150,000 a year. So they
canned it, you know, and it's a shame

5122
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:09,440
canned it, you know, and it's a shame
 

5123
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:10,870
canned it, you know, and it's a shame
because of all the potential goodwill

5124
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:10,880
because of all the potential goodwill
 

5125
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:11,990
because of all the potential goodwill
that can come out of something like

5126
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:12,000
that can come out of something like
 

5127
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,669
that can come out of something like
that. But I think those would be the two

5128
01:35:13,669 --> 01:35:13,679
that. But I think those would be the two
 

5129
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:15,350
that. But I think those would be the two
that immediately jumped to mind that

5130
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:15,360
that immediately jumped to mind that
 

5131
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,430
that immediately jumped to mind that
have surprised me the most. Um, and then

5132
01:35:17,430 --> 01:35:17,440
have surprised me the most. Um, and then
 

5133
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:19,030
have surprised me the most. Um, and then
I guess the one other part that I would

5134
01:35:19,030 --> 01:35:19,040
I guess the one other part that I would
 

5135
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:21,510
I guess the one other part that I would
say is the people who've been able to be

5136
01:35:21,510 --> 01:35:21,520
say is the people who've been able to be
 

5137
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,870
say is the people who've been able to be
very successful with AI

5138
01:35:24,870 --> 01:35:24,880
very successful with AI
 

5139
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,790
very successful with AI
who you wouldn't think would be the ones

5140
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:26,800
who you wouldn't think would be the ones
 

5141
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,709
who you wouldn't think would be the ones
that would be successful with AI has

5142
01:35:28,709 --> 01:35:28,719
that would be successful with AI has
 

5143
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:30,310
that would be successful with AI has
always been inspirational to me. So

5144
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:30,320
always been inspirational to me. So
 

5145
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:32,629
always been inspirational to me. So
allow me one more story. I have a good

5146
01:35:32,629 --> 01:35:32,639
allow me one more story. I have a good
 

5147

5229
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,830
not techsavvy in any way and but he like
needed to process all this data. So he

5230
01:36:59,830 --> 01:36:59,840
needed to process all this data. So he
 

5231
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,669
needed to process all this data. So he
did an experiment where he got Chachi PT

5232
01:37:01,669 --> 01:37:01,679
did an experiment where he got Chachi PT
 

5233
01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:03,350
did an experiment where he got Chachi PT
to do it. And this was the loaded

5234
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:03,360
to do it. And this was the loaded
 

5235
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:05,430
to do it. And this was the loaded
question like asking me was it any good.

sometimes it's easy to navigate the hype

5320
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:40,800
sometimes it's easy to navigate the hype
 

5321
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,229
sometimes it's easy to navigate the hype
to see the signal from the noise but

5322
01:38:42,229 --> 01:38:42,239
to see the signal from the noise but
 

5323
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:44,070
to see the signal from the noise but
what about people you know who don't

5324
01:38:44,070 --> 01:38:44,080
what about people you know who don't
 

5325
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,310
what about people you know who don't
have the same training as us? Um I think

5326
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:46,320
have the same training as us? Um I think
 

5327
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,149
have the same training as us? Um I think
that's our opportunity to be trusted

5328
01:38:48,149 --> 01:38:48,159
that's our opportunity to be trusted
 

5329
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:50,870
that's our opportunity to be trusted
advisers for them. Um and to really help

5330
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:50,880
advisers for them. Um and to really help
 

5331
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,350
advisers for them. Um and to really help
them through that to understand it. Um,

5332
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:53,360
them through that to understand it. Um,
 

5333
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,510
them through that to understand it. Um,
I think the biggest part in the hype

5334
01:38:55,510 --> 01:38:55,520
I think the biggest part in the hype
 

5335
01:38:55,520 --> 01:38:57,430
I think the biggest part in the hype
story right now is just understanding

5336
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:57,440
story right now is just understanding
 

5337
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,510
story right now is just understanding
the reward mechanism, right? You know,

5338
01:38:59,510 --> 01:38:59,520
the reward mechanism, right? You know,
 

5339
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,590
the reward mechanism, right? You know,
the everything rewards engagement rather

5340
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:01,600
the everything rewards engagement rather
 

5341
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,390
the everything rewards engagement rather
than actual substance. And the the to me

5342
01:39:04,390 --> 01:39:04,400
than actual substance. And the the to me
 

5343
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,390
than actual substance. And the the to me
step one is seeing through that like the

5344
01:39:06,390 --> 01:39:06,400
step one is seeing through that like the
 

5345
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,629
step one is seeing through that like the
story I just told about my friend you

5346
01:39:08,629 --> 01:39:08,639
story I just told about my friend you
 

5347
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:10,390
story I just told about my friend you
know he seen all this kind of stuff but

5348
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:10,400
know he seen all this kind of stuff but
 

5349
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:11,990
know he seen all this kind of stuff but
he wasn't willing to bet his career on

5350
01:39:11,990 --> 01:39:12,000
he wasn't willing to bet his career on
 

5351
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,910
he wasn't willing to bet his career on
it you know but he needed like that kind

5352
01:39:13,910 --> 01:39:13,920
it you know but he needed like that kind
 

5353
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:15,669

to to foster and to grow that in, you
 

5381
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:44,550
to to foster and to grow that in, you
know, um, and navigate them through the

scientific research.
>> Okay.

5396
01:39:59,430 --> 01:39:59,440

 

5397
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,510

to get your perspective on where you

5398
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:01,520
to get your perspective on where you
 

5399
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:06,790
to get your perspective on where you
think it is a good idea and

5400
01:40:06,790 --> 01:40:06,800

 

5401
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:08,790

so um AI and machine learning for

5402
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:08,800
so um AI and machine learning for
 

5403
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,709
so um AI and machine learning for
scientific research where is it a good

5404
01:40:10,709 --> 01:40:10,719
scientific research where is it a good
 

5405
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:14,470
scientific research where is it a good
idea and where should you be cautious um

5406
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:14,480
idea and where should you be cautious um
 

5407
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:17,910
idea and where should you be cautious um
oh uh I my initial gut check would be I

5408
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:17,920
oh uh I my initial gut check would be I
 

5409
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,390
oh uh I my initial gut check would be I
think it's always a good idea right um I

5410
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:20,400
think it's always a good idea right um I
 

5411
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,070
think it's always a good idea right um I
think you know there's there's no harm

5412
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:22,080
think you know there's there's no harm
 

5413
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,590
think you know there's there's no harm
in using the tools that you have

5414
01:40:23,590 --> 01:40:23,600
in using the tools that you have
 

5415
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,310
in using the tools that you have
available to to you but to always to

5416
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:26,320
available to to you but to always to
 

5417
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:27,910
available to to you but to always to
just double check your results and

5418
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:27,920
just double check your results and
 

5419
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,590
just double check your results and
double check your expectations against

5420
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:29,600
double check your expectations against
 

5421
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,109
double check your expectations against
the grounded reality. Um, I've uh always

5422
01:40:33,109 --> 01:40:33,119
the grounded reality. Um, I've uh always
 

5423
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:35,910
the grounded reality. Um, I've uh always
been a fan of using automation in

5424
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:35,920
been a fan of using automation in
 

5425
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,430
been a fan of using automation in
research as much as possible. My

5426
01:40:37,430 --> 01:40:37,440
research as much as possible. My
 

5427
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:40,229
research as much as possible. My
undergraduate was physics uh many many

5428
01:40:40,229 --> 01:40:40,239
undergraduate was physics uh many many
 

5429
01:40:40,239 --> 01:40:41,750
undergraduate was physics uh many many
years ago and I was actually very

5430
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:41,760
years ago and I was actually very
 

5431
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,350
years ago and I was actually very
successful in the lab because I usually

5432
01:40:43,350 --> 01:40:43,360
successful in the lab because I usually
 

5433
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,270
successful in the lab because I usually
automated things through a computer that

5434
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:45,280
automated things through a computer that
 

5435
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:47,270
automated things through a computer that
other people did handwriting and pen and

5436
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:47,280
other people did handwriting and pen and
 

5437
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:49,750
other people did handwriting and pen and
paper with so I could move quickly. So I

5438
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:49,760
paper with so I could move quickly. So I
 

5439
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,590
paper with so I could move quickly. So I
know I'm biased in that regard, but I

5440
01:40:51,590 --> 01:40:51,600
know I'm biased in that regard, but I
 

5441
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,830
know I'm biased in that regard, but I
would say like for most research for the

5442
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:53,840
would say like for most research for the
 

5443
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,910
would say like for most research for the
most part I think you know use the most

5444
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:55,920
most part I think you know use the most
 

5445
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,590
most part I think you know use the most
powerful tools you have available but

5446
01:40:57,590 --> 01:40:57,600
powerful tools you have available but
 

5447
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:03,270
powerful tools you have available but
check your expectations.

5448
01:41:03,270 --> 01:41:03,280

actually did my undergraduate in Wales

5460
01:41:19,109 --> 01:41:19,119
actually did my undergraduate in Wales
 

5461
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:21,510
actually did my undergraduate in Wales
and I went back to do some lectures in

5462
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:21,520
and I went back to do some lectures in
 

5463
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:25,270
and I went back to do some lectures in
the university there and um I met with a

5464
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:25,280
the university there and um I met with a
 

5465
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,030
the university there and um I met with a
researcher there and he was doing

5466
01:41:27,030 --> 01:41:27,040
researcher there and he was doing
 

5467
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,990
researcher there and he was doing
research into brain cancer um using

5468
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:30,000
research into brain cancer um using
 

5469
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,750
research into brain cancer um using
computer imagery and using various types

5470
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:31,760
computer imagery and using various types
 

5471
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,750
computer imagery and using various types
of computer imagery and I asked him

5472
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:33,760
of computer imagery and I asked him
 

5473
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,070
of computer imagery and I asked him
what's the biggest problem that you have

5474
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:36,080
what's the biggest problem that you have
 

5475
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,750
what's the biggest problem that you have
what's the biggest blocker for your

5476
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:37,760
what's the biggest blocker for your
 

5477
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,030
what's the biggest blocker for your
research and this is about eight years

5478
01:41:39,030 --> 01:41:39,040
research and this is about eight years
 

5479
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:43,830
research and this is about eight years
ago and his answer was access to a GPU

5480
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:43,840
ago and his answer was access to a GPU
 

5481
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,310
ago and his answer was access to a GPU
and uh cuz like for him to be able to

5482
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:46,320
and uh cuz like for him to be able to
 

5483
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:47,830
and uh cuz like for him to be able to
train his models and run his models, he

5484
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:47,840
train his models and run his models, he
 

5485
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:50,950
train his models and run his models, he
needed to be able to access a GPU. And

5486
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:50,960
needed to be able to access a GPU. And
 

5487
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:53,430
needed to be able to access a GPU. And
uh the department that he was in had one

5488
01:41:53,430 --> 01:41:53,440
uh the department that he was in had one
 

5489
01:41:53,440 --> 01:41:55,990
uh the department that he was in had one
GPU between 10 researchers, which meant

5490
01:41:55,990 --> 01:41:56,000
GPU between 10 researchers, which meant
 

5491
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,590
GPU between 10 researchers, which meant
that everybody got it for half a day,

5492
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:57,600
that everybody got it for half a day,
 

5493
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:58,950
that everybody got it for half a day,
right? Monday through Friday. And his

5494
01:41:58,950 --> 01:41:58,960
right? Monday through Friday. And his
 

5495
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,270
right? Monday through Friday. And his
half a day was Tuesday afternoon. So in

5496
01:42:01,270 --> 01:42:01,280
half a day was Tuesday afternoon. So in
 

5497
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,790
half a day was Tuesday afternoon. So in
his case, he would spend the entire time

5498
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:02,800
his case, he would spend the entire time
 

5499
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,709
his case, he would spend the entire time
that wasn't Tuesday afternoon preparing

5500
01:42:04,709 --> 01:42:04,719
that wasn't Tuesday afternoon preparing
 

5501
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,550
that wasn't Tuesday afternoon preparing
everything for his model run or his

5502
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:06,560
everything for his model run or his
 

5503
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:08,070
everything for his model run or his
model training or everything like that.

5504
01:42:08,070 --> 01:42:08,080
model training or everything like that.
 

5505
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:10,070
model training or everything like that.
And then Tuesday afternoon once he had

5506
01:42:10,070 --> 01:42:10,080
And then Tuesday afternoon once he had
 

5507
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:11,830
And then Tuesday afternoon once he had
access to the GPU, then he would do the

5508
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:11,840
access to the GPU, then he would do the
 

5509
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,590
access to the GPU, then he would do the
training, right? And then he would hope

5510
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:13,600
training, right? And then he would hope
 

5511
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,109
training, right? And then he would hope
that in that time that he would train

5512
01:42:15,109 --> 01:42:15,119
that in that time that he would train
 

5513
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:16,550
that in that time that he would train
his model and he would get the results

5514
01:42:16,550 --> 01:42:16,560
his model and he would get the results
 

5515
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:18,229
his model and he would get the results
that he wanted. Otherwise, he'd have to

5516
01:42:18,229 --> 01:42:18,239
that he wanted. Otherwise, he'd have to
 

5517
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:19,990
that he wanted. Otherwise, he'd have to
wait a week, you know, to get access to

5518
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:20,000
wait a week, you know, to get access to
 

5519
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,229
wait a week, you know, to get access to
the GPU again. Uh, and then I showed him

5520
01:42:22,229 --> 01:42:22,239
the GPU again. Uh, and then I showed him
 

5521
01:42:22,239 --> 01:42:24,390
the GPU again. Uh, and then I showed him
Google Collab, right? Had anybody ever

5522
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:24,400
Google Collab, right? Had anybody ever
 

5523
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:26,550
Google Collab, right? Had anybody ever
used Google Collab, right? And you can

5524
01:42:26,550 --> 01:42:26,560
used Google Collab, right? And you can
 

5525
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,950
used Google Collab, right? And you can
have a GPU in the cloud for free with

5526
01:42:28,950 --> 01:42:28,960
have a GPU in the cloud for free with
 

5527
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:30,310
have a GPU in the cloud for free with
that kind of thing. And the poor guy's

5528
01:42:30,310 --> 01:42:30,320
that kind of thing. And the poor guy's
 

5529
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,790
that kind of thing. And the poor guy's
brain melted, right? Um, that, you know,

5530
01:42:32,790 --> 01:42:32,800
brain melted, right? Um, that, you know,
 

5531
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,629
brain melted, right? Um, that, you know,
because I took out my phone and I showed

5532
01:42:34,629 --> 01:42:34,639
because I took out my phone and I showed
 

5533
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:36,310
because I took out my phone and I showed
him a notebook running on my phone and

5534
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:36,320
him a notebook running on my phone and
 

5535
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,149
him a notebook running on my phone and
Google Collab and training it on that

5536
01:42:38,149 --> 01:42:38,159
Google Collab and training it on that
 

5537
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:39,590
Google Collab and training it on that
and it changed everything for him

5538
01:42:39,590 --> 01:42:39,600
and it changed everything for him
 

5539
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:42,310
and it changed everything for him
research-wise. Um and you know now it

5540
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:42,320
research-wise. Um and you know now it
 

5541
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:43,669
research-wise. Um and you know now it
was a case of and this was with free

5542
01:42:43,669 --> 01:42:43,679
was a case of and this was with free
 

5543
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:45,270
was a case of and this was with free
collab he had much more than he had with

5544
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:45,280
collab he had much more than he had with
 

5545
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:47,669
collab he had much more than he had with
his shared GPU. So I think you know for

5546
01:42:47,669 --> 01:42:47,679
his shared GPU. So I think you know for
 

5547
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:49,430
his shared GPU. So I think you know for
someone like him you know machine

5548
01:42:49,430 --> 01:42:49,440
someone like him you know machine
 

5549
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:50,709
someone like him you know machine
learning was an important part of his

5550
01:42:50,709 --> 01:42:50,719
learning was an important part of his
 

5551
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:53,510
learning was an important part of his
research but he was so gated on it that

5552
01:42:53,510 --> 01:42:53,520
research but he was so gated on it that
 

5553
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:55,990
research but he was so gated on it that
the ability to widen access to that

5554
01:42:55,990 --> 01:42:56,000
the ability to widen access to that
 

5555
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,750
the ability to widen access to that
ended up like really really advancing

5556
01:42:57,750 --> 01:42:57,760
ended up like really really advancing
 

5557
01:42:57,760 --> 01:42:58,870
ended up like really really advancing
his research. I don't know where it

5558
01:42:58,870 --> 01:42:58,880
his research. I don't know where it
 

5559
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,229
his research. I don't know where it
ended up. I don't know what he has done.

5560
01:43:00,229 --> 01:43:00,239
ended up. I don't know what he has done.
 

5561
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:02,229
ended up. I don't know what he has done.
It has been a few years since then but

5562
01:43:02,229 --> 01:43:02,239
It has been a few years since then but
 

5563
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:03,750
It has been a few years since then but
you know that story just came to mind

5564
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:03,760
you know that story just came to mind
 

5565
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,870
you know that story just came to mind
when you asked the question.

5566
01:43:06,870 --> 01:43:06,880
when you asked the question.
 

5567
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:10,470
when you asked the question.
Any more questions? Any feel free to ask

5568
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:10,480
Any more questions? Any feel free to ask
 

5569
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:14,470
Any more questions? Any feel free to ask
me anything.

5570
01:43:14,470 --> 01:43:14,480

 

5571
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:23,510

Oh yeah, at the front here

5572
01:43:23,510 --> 01:43:23,520

 

5573
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:27,510

force of sociality or sociality.

5574
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:27,520
force of sociality or sociality.
 

5575
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:30,070
force of sociality or sociality.
>> So can AI be a force of social equality

5576
01:43:30,070 --> 01:43:30,080
>> So can AI be a force of social equality
 

5577
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,790
>> So can AI be a force of social equality
or social inequality? Um I think the

5578
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:32,800
or social inequality? Um I think the
 

5579
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:35,830
or social inequality? Um I think the
answer to that is yes. It can be both

5580
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:35,840
answer to that is yes. It can be both
 

5581
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:38,229
answer to that is yes. It can be both
and it can be neither. I mean I think

5582
01:43:38,229 --> 01:43:38,239
and it can be neither. I mean I think
 

5583
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:40,870
and it can be neither. I mean I think
that ultimately the idea is that if in

5584
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:40,880
that ultimately the idea is that if in
 

5585
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:44,470
that ultimately the idea is that if in
my opinion any tool can be used for any

5586
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:44,480
my opinion any tool can be used for any
 

5587
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:46,790
my opinion any tool can be used for any
means. So the important thing is to

5588
01:43:46,790 --> 01:43:46,800
means. So the important thing is to
 

5589
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,270
means. So the important thing is to
educate and inspire people towards using

5590
01:43:49,270 --> 01:43:49,280
educate and inspire people towards using
 

5591
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:51,590
educate and inspire people towards using
things for the correct means. Um there's

5592
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:51,600
things for the correct means. Um there's
 

5593
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,350
things for the correct means. Um there's
only so much governance can be applied

5594
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:53,360
only so much governance can be applied
 

5595
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,910
only so much governance can be applied
and sometimes governance can cause more

5596
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:55,920
and sometimes governance can cause more
 

5597
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:00,470
and sometimes governance can cause more
problems than it solves. Um, so I always

5598
01:44:00,470 --> 01:44:00,480
problems than it solves. Um, so I always
 

5599
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:02,550
problems than it solves. Um, so I always
love to live my life by assuming good

5600
01:44:02,550 --> 01:44:02,560
love to live my life by assuming good
 

5601
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:05,830
love to live my life by assuming good
intent but preparing for bad intent. And

5602
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:05,840
intent but preparing for bad intent. And
 

5603
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,510
intent but preparing for bad intent. And
in the case of AI, I don't think there's

5604
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:07,520
in the case of AI, I don't think there's
 

5605
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:08,790
in the case of AI, I don't think there's
any difference there that everything

5606
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:08,800
any difference there that everything
 

5607
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:10,070
any difference there that everything
that I would do and everything that I

5608
01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:10,080
that I would do and everything that I
 

5609
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,149
that I would do and everything that I
would advise is assuming good intent

5610
01:44:12,149 --> 01:44:12,159
would advise is assuming good intent
 

5611
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:13,590
would advise is assuming good intent
that people would use it for good

5612
01:44:13,590 --> 01:44:13,600
that people would use it for good
 

5613
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,229
that people would use it for good
things, but also to be prepared for it

5614
01:44:16,229 --> 01:44:16,239
things, but also to be prepared for it
 

5615
01:44:16,239 --> 01:44:19,350
things, but also to be prepared for it

I showed earlier on I think were good
 

5619

I showed earlier on I think were good
intent rather than bad intent. Um, and

5620
01:44:24,870 --> 01:44:24,880
intent rather than bad intent. Um, and
 

5621
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,870
intent rather than bad intent. Um, and

most mistakes that I see like that are
 

5623
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:29,350
most mistakes that I see like that are
good intent being used mistakenly as

01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:29,360
good intent being used mistakenly as
 

5625
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:31,830
good intent being used mistakenly as
opposed to bad intent. But I would say

5626
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:31,840
opposed to bad intent. But I would say
 

5627

that's the only mantra that I can the
only advice that I can give in that kind

of thing is always assume good intent
 

5633
01:44:37,119 --> 01:44:40,310
of thing is always assume good intent
but prepare for bad intent.

5634
01:44:40,310 --> 01:44:40,320
but prepare for bad intent.
